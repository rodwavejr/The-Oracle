China’s Evergrande files for bankruptcy
From the article:

>  China’s Evergrande Group — once the country’s second-largest property developer — filed for bankruptcy in New York on Thursday.

> The beleaguered firm borrowed heavily and defaulted on its debt in 2021, sparking a massive property crisis in China’s economy, which continues to feel the effects.

And an interesting note on their debt:

> The property company’s debt load reached 2.437 trillion yuan ($340 billion) by the end of last year. That is roughly 2% of China’s entire gross domestic product.

News coming out of China are terrible right now. Should people be worried?
So I have a subscription to WSJ, and it seems like there have been tons of negative news about China in the past few weeks:

Is it possible to find an all-in-one list of the retail, investable bond universe?
Hello all,

I enjoy building filters of equities and wanted to build one for the bond universe, but I am having difficulty locating a list of bonds that, as a retail account, I can invest in. All of the lists I find includes the institutional universe (144A/RegS), which I do not have the ability to invest in. If anyone has a recommended data source of CUSIPs/company names/individual securities, then I'd very much appreciate the help!

Thank you ahead of time for any guidance.

Swedish Conglomerate tumbles 30% in the stock market
Storskogen is a conglomerate or an **international group of businesses** across trade, industry, and services operating in a decentralized model to acquire and develop market-leading niche companies.

It reported 2Q 2023 this week and was **trading at -28% from previous day close**

Here is a summary of Storskogen's financial performance based on their second quarter 2023 earnings release:

|Financial Metric|Q2 2022|Q2 2023|Change|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Revenue|SEK 9,059M|SEK 9,462M|\+4%|
|Adjusted EBITA|SEK 877M|SEK 922M|\+5%|
|Operating Profit|SEK 681M|SEK 605M|\-11%|
|Operating Margin|7.5%|6.4%|\-1.1pp|
|Net Income|SEK 474M|SEK 115M|\-76%|
|EPS|SEK 0.25|SEK 0.04|\-83%|

\- **Profit** for the period **fell 76%** to SEK 115 million.

\- The Trade business area saw lower consumer demand affecting sales and profits. The Services business area improved thanks to high occupancy rates. Industry continued to perform well.

\- Cash flow from operating activities increased significantly to SEK 852 million from SEK 335 million last year.- Net debt to adjusted EBITDA remained stable at 2.6x.

Overall, Storskogen delivered modest top line growth but profits declined amid a tougher economic climate mainly affecting consumer sentiment. The company maintained a strong financial position and cash flows improved markedly. Storskogen continues to focus on cash flow generation and profitability in the near term.

&#x200B;

It is a good business and management seem to have a good track record in the field. Let's breakdown in simple words how they make money:

>*Storskogen* is a conglomerate that owns a portfolio of small and medium-sized businesses across three segments - **Trade, Industry, and Services.**  
>  
>The **Trade** segment includes distributors and wholesalers of physical products like home furnishings, health and beauty items, sports equipment, etc. This segment generates revenue by selling these products to retailers or directly to consumers.  
>  
>The **Industry** segment contains traditional industrial companies involved in manufacturing, automation, and technology services. These companies make money by producing and selling various industrial products and solutions.  
>  
>The **Services** segment provides business-to-business services in areas like contracting, infrastructure, installation, logistics, and more. Revenue comes from selling these services to other businesses.  
>  
>Storskogen aims to acquire profitable niche businesses in these segments and help them grow further under its ownership. The operating companies charge their customers for the products or services provided.  
>  
>At the parent level, Storskogen derives profits from the earnings of all the operating businesses it owns. By having a diversified portfolio across segments, Storskogen can maintain stable cash flows as some segments may perform better than others in different market conditions.So in summary, Storskogen generates revenue through the sales of its underlying business units and creates shareholder value by acquiring, growing and operating a diverse mix of companies. The decentralized model allows each unit to focus on its respective industry and customers.

These are the companies they hold:

I am keeping an eye to see if the downturn is just macro-economic environment that affects everyone, or if it is something specific of the company
Is it a bad idea to put more than $250k in a CD?
CD I am looking at is FDIC insured up to $250k.  I am single so I cant raise that limit.  

Would it be a bad idea to park more than $250k in a CD from places like Vanguard or Ally?  What would be the risks of doing so?    


From what I understand, the likelihood of these banks going down is super low, but how low?
Putting money in CDs VS Treasury Bonds/Bills
I am trying to decide whether it makes sense to invest some of my cash in CDs(12-24 months) or in US Treasuries.

Lot of banks are offering \~5% rate for 12-24 month CDs. Buying US Treasuries seems to have a similar return over next 1-2 yrs.

Assuming rate of return is similar(correct me if I am wrong in this assumption) what else should I consider? Which is a better investment option?

Open AI investing - as accredited investor ?
Would any of you recommend investing 50 K into Open AI. My friend is about to do it and suggested it to me. But I’m doubtful about the current valuation at 29 B and long term growth as AI competition is stiff, and how much can Open AI profit. Worth it or NOT ?
Adyen - One of the biggest Stripe & Paypal competitor in Europe is down 30% today
Stock is down 30% and I am a bit shocked and at the same time thinking on buying it

\*\***Background:**\*\*Adyen is a company that provides payment processing and acquiring services to merchants. They work with third parties like financial institutions and network scheme providers to enable these services.The fees charged to Adyen by these third parties are known as "pass-through settlement fees", which include interchange and payment network fees.

|Financial Metric|H1 2022|H1 2023|YoY Change|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|**Revenue**|€3,947M|€854M|**-78%**|
|**Net Revenue**|€609M|€739M|**+21%**|
|Operating Income|€331M|€279M|\-16%|
|**Net Income**|€282M|€282M|**Flat**|
|Diluted EPS|€9.09|€9.07|\-0.2%|
|EBITDA|€356M|€320M|\-10%|
|EBITDA Margin|59%|43%|\-16pp|
|Free Cash Flow|€309M|€248M|\-20%|
|Cash Balance|€5,584M|€6,412M|\+15%|

The significant decline in revenue was due to the change in revenue recognition methodology for settlement fees in 2023. Net revenue, which excludes settlement fees, increased 21%.

\*\***Previous Policy**:\*\*Up to December 31, 2022, Adyen considered itself primarily responsible for providing payment transaction services. This means they had control over the full settlement service before it was transferred to merchants. In accounting terms, Adyen acted as the "Principal" for these fees. When acting as a Principal:Adyen would recognize both the revenue from the fees charged to merchants and the costs from the third parties on a gross basis. This means both the revenue and the costs were shown in full in the financial statements.

\*\***Change in Policy**:\*\*In H1 2023, Adyen made changes to its terms and conditions related to merchant agreements. These changes clarified the roles and responsibilities of the services provided by third parties. The key points from this change are:Adyen does not provide a significant service of integrating the services from third parties into one combined output for the merchant.Adyen does not control the inputs from third parties before services are provided to the merchant.Because of these changes, Adyen now acts as an "Agent" for the pass-through settlement fees, effective from January 1, 2023.

\*\***Impact of Acting as an Agent**:\*\*When acting as an Agent:Adyen only recognizes the net amount (i.e., the difference between what they charge the merchant and what they pay to third parties) in the revenue. This means the gross revenue and the costs from third parties are no longer shown in full in the financial statements.

\*\***Financial Impact**:\*\*Looking at the financial data provided:In H1 2022 (before the change), Settlement fees were €3,641,350 and Costs incurred from financial institutions were €3,313,269.In H1 2023 (after the change), Settlement fees dropped significantly to €485,582, and Costs incurred from financial institutions were only €74,409.This drastic reduction is because, in 2023, Adyen is only recognizing the net amount in the revenue, whereas in 2022, they were recognizing the full gross amount.

This is how the Revenue growth in the last 9 Yrs looks like:[https://snipboard.io/1vM0jO.jpg](https://snipboard.io/1vM0jO.jpg)

**EDIT**: As promised, this is the trend of the real metric that matters for this company:

|H1 2018|156.4|\-|

|H2 2022|721.7|18.6%|

Corp bonds/CD vs T-Bills in Florida
Apparently in the state of Florida I wouldn’t have to pay state tax on capital gains, in this case higher yield CDs or bonds would give me a better return than T-bills given I only pay fed taxes on the former?(with Tbills at 5.3% no state tax).Which corporate CDs/bonds offer a higher rate than T-bills at short term (4week-3month) with similar value protections?
KHC undervalued, but wondering why
Hello,

I'm building a value based dividend portfolio and I noticed something very attractive.

KHC is currently trading around 34$, while it's book value per share is 40$, it also has a cool 13 P/E ratio. Their financials are looking good this year, and they have been beating expectations for 4 qt's in a row, they have doubled their income to breach the 1Bil mark and their EPS has been trending upwards.

Does anyone know why would KHC be trading below their book value with good financials, especially in a market where everything seems overvalued?
Diversified Investment strategy, when to make strategic changes?
Hi, many boomer retail investors have a standard diversification strategy with for example 50% equity funds, 40% bond funds, 10% cash or something like that. The manager will do micro adjustments within each type, but essentially says, we leave it alone as we go through the natural ups and downs of the economy. My question, when do we make bigger decisions regarding one of those segments if there are major indicators of change? 

For example Bond ETFs which were a stabilizing force in past years, were predictably going to crash with post pandemic inflation and the consequential central banks rate rise. Many large institutional investors seemed to see this coming and the rush to sell began. Meanwhile most retail investment managers chose to do nothing to exit their position in bond ETFs.

Today there is still very little motivation to enter the bond etf market, yet retail managers are saying don’t worry it will bounce back. It feels like a basic failure of expert judgement during a time of significant predictable change in macro indicators.

So to repeat the question, under what conditions do we make strategic change to a highly diversified portfolio?

Edit: If this sub is meant for equity share investing, and not Equity and Bond ETF funds investors then I apologize, I’m in the wrong sub.
CD's vs Treasury Bonds: Help me pick
My only income would be the 250K I been investing in CD's at around 5.1%. At this rate I would be making about 13k a year in CD's in NY State. How much would I get taxed on this being its my only income. My friend told me I should invest in US Treasury Bonds that yield around 5.3%. I want something that 100% guaranteed, nothing that can fail or go to zero.
tax exempt etf no use for tax loss harvesting
Might be obvious, but wanted to check since I am not sure. 

MUB etf (municipal bond is federal and state tax free). If I wanted to sell my bond etf which is down 10%, can I claim it as a tax loss (deduct from the gains)? I am guessing since you don't pay tax on gain, you don't get the benefit the other way around, but wanted to check what the rules were.

Thanks!
Ratemyportoflio : 45% VTI 40% VXUS 5% AVUV 5% AVDV 5% AVDS.
35 years old, long term horizon, trying to grow my capital for the next 20 years+.

Current Portfolio is :

* 45% VTI (all us market)
* 40% VXUS (all world market excluding US)
* 5% AVUV (US small cap value)
* 5% AVDV (international small cap value)

Any advice?

Should I simply go with VT so I don't need to rebalance?

Opened a Roth IRA with Fidelity
I just opened a Roth IRA with Fidelity and am completely overwhelmed by all the options. I am 33, making 51.9k a year. I have a 401k through my company that I contribute 12% with a 33% match. I have $15k of stock from my last company I am holding and no longer contributing to. Then I have my emergency fund and some CDs. I feel terribly behind and hoping to start now. I am just at a loss of what to choose for my IRA. Any suggestions?
Investing in Australian Banks
Hello everyone. I was wondering if anyone has any insight on the best way for an American to invest in Australian banks? I own stock in one of the US mega cap banks, several regional banks and two Canadian mega banks and I've heard a lot about how stable/safe Australian banks are...i.e Australia hasn't had a recession this century....very stable dividend payers exc...

I'm sure there are some who might think my interest in the topic is foolish with all the investments I could be making closer to home, and if i'm dead wrong in thinking they would be a good investment then please tell me, but i'm honestly not looking for a critique of my thesis as much as just how I would go about it. I own close to 50 stocks/eft's but have never tried to buy anything over the counter or anything outside the US/Canada. If anyone has any insight i'd deeply appreciate it and I'd like to thank you for your time in advance. 
Typical market reaponse to spinoff? Any clue what happens to my GM stock if Cruise LLC does spinoff and go public?

Thanks for any input! Obviously you can't predict outcomes, but what would be likely to occur?

Choose Your Fighter: SGOV or USFR?
I've been buying individual T-bills in bi-weekly ladders (Mostly 17-week, but some 26-week), but have read some compelling posts on the wisdom of instead just buying something like SGOV or USFR for liquidity and simplicity.  
Between the two, SGOV and USFR, which is the better choice?  
Is there another that would be better?
Lex in depth: how investors are underpricing climate risks
*So far, businesses and investors have paid less attention to the physical effects of climate change and more to the costs and risks of decarbonising, as the world tries to limit the rise in average global temperatures. The former is discussed half as frequently as the latter in US corporate disclosures, according to the Brookings think-tank(opens a new window).*

*Equities have not priced in climate change risks, research by the IMF and others has repeatedly shown.*

*The perceived remoteness(opens a new window) of risks such as sea level rises is one explanation. Another is the formidable difficulty of mapping interactions between the economy and greenhouse gas emissions. Nobel Prize winner William Nordhaus, who began modelling climate change as far back as 1975, describes this as the thorniest problem of all. Assessing abatement costs is “simple stuff” by comparison, he says.*

*Vast computing power is trying to solve the conundrum. The data group Cambridge Econometrics and Ortec Finance recently crunched numbers for Singapore’s GIC. The sovereign wealth fund’s long-term investment horizon — and the city-state’s vulnerability to flooding — make it unusually mindful of climate risks. It wanted to know how a portfolio composed of 60 per cent global equities and 40 per cent bonds would fare under varying climate policies. big danger is of a “climate Minsky moment”, the term for a sudden correction in asset values as investors simultaneously realise those values are unsustainable.*

Fed Sees Significant Inflation Risk That May Merit More Hikes - Bloomberg
[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-08-16/fed-saw-significant-inflation-risk-that-may-merit-more-hikes](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-08-16/fed-saw-significant-inflation-risk-that-may-merit-more-hikes)

Fed minutes just got released:

*"Federal Reserve officials at their last meeting largely remained concerned that inflation would fail to recede and suggested they may continue raising interest rates.“Most participants continued to see significant upside risks to inflation, which could require further tightening of monetary policy,” according to minutes of the US central bank’s July 25-26 policy meeting published Wednesday in Washington."*

So expect more rate hikes to come! For those wondering, that means bonds would go down making yields go up.

Unique asset stocks for my retirement fund
Been thinking about building an, in theory, defensive portfolio for my pension. Having similar parallels to global brand funds but with a more tangible moat, unique assets. For example my thoughts are that nike is a global brand, but not a unique asset. A few names that i think fit my bill are Canadian Pacific, ASML, Linde, Nintendo/Disney, Apple. These are all businesses in a monopoly, oligopoly, historic IP or entrenched ecosystem.
Do you think any of these names are disputable? Would like to here peoples own suggestions for companies? Or even if you think the whole premise is flawed?

Edit: I have 30 years before I touch this pot and fully accept the risk of an equity portfolio. Maybe defensive was the wrong word, better to have said growth companies that due to their unique position might me a lot more defensive.
Men’s Underwear Index - trouble brewing ahead?
The men’s underwear index (MUI) measures the sale of men’s underwear. Some have argued that it is an indicator of economic woes / recession. The belief is that during good times, men (or someone buys for their man) will purchase men’s underwear. The flip side is that when times are getting tougher, men’s underwear sales suffer and this can be a canary in the coal mine indicator. I believe that there is a similar strip club index. Both make sense, this seems easier to track. Thoughts on the weight this holds?

What's the best way to buy and hold bonds?
I used to use [VBTLX](https://investor.vanguard.com/investment-products/mutual-funds/profile/vbtlx). But its return YTD is 2.18% and even worse on other periods (3 yr is negative).

It's [exposure to US Gov't bonds](https://investor.vanguard.com/investment-products/mutual-funds/profile/vbtlx#portfolio-composition) is 69% and T-Bills/T-Bonds **have been paying 5%+ for a while**.

So is VBTLX just a bad index? It's 10 yr return is 3% so it's basically just struggling to keep up with inflation.

Any reason not to move everything into T-bills @ 5%? 

Is there a better way to invest in bonds?  Or am I misunderstanding something?
Invested retirement and individual accounts in ARK and lost 60%
During Covid, back when I knew very little about investing, I saw how well the ARK funds were doing so I invested a good bit of money into them. They did spectacularly well, with gains up to 40-50%. 

So I decided I’d do the same in my 401k and my Roth IRA.

Then, it all came crashing down and now I am down about 50-60% in all my accounts. 

I’m aware it was a terrible decision to do this and I’m not sure how to move on 3 years later.

I’ve been hoping for a recovery and a small one did occur, but now they’ve come crashing down again these past 2 weeks and I’m sick and tired of carrying this burden, but I’m also not sure where I could put the money instead which would recover my losses, and I keep thinking ARK should have the potential to do that given the massive crash that occurred and the consolidation phase it’s been in for the last year.

I made a decision 10+ years ago to invest heavily in international. IXUS is my largest holding. My logic at the time was that since I live and work in the U.S., international investing would be a bit of a hedge. International was also much cheaper on about every metric CAPE, PE, P/B etc. as it remains today.

Of course I've only gotten punished for my decision since then with the U.S. continuing to outperform. But when I bat around the idea of making changes now I find it hard to swallow that the U.S. will continue to outperform again for another 10 years. Am I crazy to stick with a portfolio heavily weighted towards intl?

I've got Fidelity ETFs but I'm sure the numbers are close for Vanguard:

IXUS: P/E of 13, yield of 2.3%, P/B of 1.7

ITOT: P/E of 21, yield of 1.4%, P/B of 3.7

Like what is more likely, the rest of the world seeing 50% multiple expansion to get to a P/E of 19.5 or the U.S. seeing the same to get to a PE of 31.5 or choose your own favorite scenario/metric. Maybe the numbers would get a little closer if you were to strip out the high flyers like AAPL, NVDA, TSLA, etc. I have been building out a position in SCHD to help get a little more balance but am I nuts to stay the course?

Is there a way to get yield on your cash sitting at the broker account?
My account is in interactive brokers, I'm not a US citizen.

In my private bank account I'm getting a yield of 4.3% on cash deposit with a station every 7 Days, where i can put nore money or withdraw from the deposit, without any fines.

This is making the cash i have in interactive brokers very lazy l, as it does nothing.

Hoe can i sit on cash, or cash equivalent assets or financial tools that provide yeild, while still have the flexibility to withdraw when i want to invest in stocks?
VEU vs VXUS / Portfolio Review?
I am holding the following portfolio in my ROTH IRA. 27F:

Stock holdings: 90% of total
VTI: 70%
VEU: 25%
VNQ: 5%

Bond holdings: BDNW: 10% of total 


Should I be moving to VXUS instead of VEU? Would I begin adding it or transfer it over?

Also how’s my portfolio allocation? Any suggestions are encouraged and welcomed. Thanks!

Is Warren Buffet’s holding period forever?
Warren Buffet says he likes to buy companies where the holding period is for ever. Yet we look the difference in his portfolio between 2012 and 2022 and it’s drastically changed. Not even one company here has stood the “holding forever” period. Berkshire might be a different story. Pretty sure I heard Buffet say that he would only increase his stake in a company, like Coca-Cola if they were to retain shares, which they did and yet in 2022 he significantly reduced his Coca-Cola shares. What gives? He’s practicing something different to what he says.

What to do with income that can’t be put in a retirement account?
I am a teacher. I work full time and have a 403b, which I have maxed out. I also have a Roth IRA. 

I get supplemental income from teaching lessons on the side. In addition, I also have a small LLC. For both of these, I cannot (obviously) funnel funds into a retirement fund.

What is the best way to invest this money?
In the next 20 years. Whats going to appreciate more? Silver, gold or Platinum
So I’ve been buying gold since I was 18. I’m 43 now. I figured precious metals would be the ticket and I’m more than happy with those purchases BUT… I’m thinking about my daughter’s future. Should I continue buying precious metals and if so should I switch to Platinum or stay with gold?
The SEC is Zeroing In on ESG
The Financial Times reported Tuesday that the Securities and Exchange Commission has been in touch with a few fund managers, including some via subpoena, to find out more about their environmental, social and governance (ESG) disclosures. It signals the regulatory snare is just starting to tighten on ESG stocks.

AC companies to invest in? (EU)
Hi everyone!

I live in central Europe. Every summer keeps getting hotter, with new heat records. Where I live most Houses/Apartments historically do not have air conditioning. However I believe that over the next 5-10 years many households will get ACs, due to the increasing heat. What are some ways to invest into this trend?
Financial adviser - what are the pros and cons?
My mom uses a financial advisor and pays the standard 1%. I’ve tried telling her she should pay a lawyer or an advisor a set rate for specific projects and I’ve explained to her how much money she would save. She doesn’t listen. Maybe I am wrong. What are the reasons to use a financial advisor and pay more? It seems like they always get their hooks into the older wealthier people. Is it an aversion to loss that explains this? Is there anything anyone can suggest as to an approach to helping my mom save her hard earned money?
Should I Pay into the Mortgage or into 403b?
I am a teacher who moved districts and recently got a raise.  I would like to do something with the extra in my paycheck.  

I have about 20 years until retirement and 20 years left on my mortgage.  Mortgage rate is 2.5%.  Is it better to use these funds to pay into the 403b or pay into the mortgage?

Can someone also please explain why? I’m new to all of this so any help is appreciated.
Alternatives to retirement accounts?
So I'm 32 now, and don't have any retirement funds. I know, to many this sounds crazy. Long story short I didn't contribute in my 20's because I was paycheck to paycheck, and over the last 3 years I was stacking cash for a home. My wife and I decided to hold off on a house, so I'm going to start investing. What I really don't like about a 401k/Traditional IRA is that my money is tied up for decades. I'd get a 3% match from my employer which is great free money, but I can't access it without huge penalties. If I want to withdraw my investments and buy into a business venture, I can't. If I have a financial emergency, I'll lose thousands for withdrawing.

For the last year I've been dumping my savings into CD's. It's not too bad- 5% returns every 6 months, but i need to do more. What are some alternative investments that are equally "safe", but allow me access without penalty, if any?

Or am I being crazy and should definitely be pouring my money into a retirement account that I may potentially never see? (sorry, I've lost multiple family members who died right after retirement and never enjoyed the money they deprived themselves from their whole lives)
Investing, living in the UK
I started my investing journey with crypto and progressively enlarged my interest into a wider audience of markets, including stocks and commodity.

I know nothing about the ways to access to these market, also being an expat living in the UK, I really want to make sure I am not putting myself into kore troubles with tax etc and I choose an appropriate platform.

English not being my language I get a bit confused with all the terms, brokers etc.
So I am not sure exactly what I should be looking for.
With crypto it seemed easier to understand: get access with an exchange, then you have dex if you feel like it.

Can I get some help and advices on platform and taxes in the UK? Bonus for expat tips!
Should I sell AAPL and META?
I bought 5k worth of AAPL and and 5k worth of META a few months ago. It went up maybe 5% but has since pulled back 10% so I’m sitting at -5% overall and they just keep sinking day after day after day. I know the sentiment here is “time in the market beats timing the market” but these shares in particular have made a complete 180 since I purchased them. Should I dump them and cut my losses and then buy back in when the prices are steadily moving up again? 

Even when I specifically don’t try to time the market, I still always seem to buy in at the worst possible time. 😞

Also, student loans resume next month and that 9.5k would make a big dent in my loan balance… Should I cut my losses and use the money on something with guaranteed “returns”?
Psychology behind Selling a position
On the subject of SELL - agree it’s a hard decision.  

Obviously, there are multiple valid reasons to sell - thesis is broken/ridiculous valuation/personal expenses.  

However, even knowing all this I struggle to sell positions even when they are way down. Sometimes it’s because of this mental roadblock about “registering” losses way more than can be offset in taxes. And I “justify” it to myself that as part of a Buy & Hold /CoffeeCan investing style.  
How do y’all deal with it? Any advice on how should I look at this?
How do I diversify? Trying to move out of single stocks into ETFs.
I have a taxable brokerage account worth about 260k currently. 

There are currently 93 positions and account is mainly being carried by big tech stocks (Apple/AMD/Tesla) and a bunch of others for 1-2k each gain/loss.

How do I go about the process of getting out of these single stocks into ETF/Index Funds? I am worried about having to pay taxes on anything I sell but is this just part of the game? Sell something, buy something else, and pay taxes on whatever gains are from the stock I sold?

What about losses? I barely know anything about tax loss harvesting. 

I am kind of just trying to figure out if there is anyway to clean up this portfolio for myself for the future.

Thanks to all in advance!!


TLDR: How to move from single stocks to index funds
What stock data site was this?
Hey, 

a while back I had found a stock data site that when you searched a ticker it also brought up the industry and sector averages of whatever ratio or number you were looking at so you could compare.  I have looked and looked but I can't find the site.  Hoping someone might remember what site it was.  I know its not the following 

yahoo finance, google finance, benzinga, finviz, stockmarket watch, market chameleon, alpha query, barchart, ally data, fidelity, fdscanner, street insider, trading view, pimeyes, option strat, seeking alpha, tijorifinance, nasdaq, simplywall st.  
Should I cash out my inherited IRA and max out a mega backdoor Roth 401k?
My folks left me an IRA worth about 200k in the 2000s. Since then I’ve been taking minimum distributions which at my age is about 3-4pct per year. As a result it’s been gaining in value and is now worth about 300k. Note that any withdrawals are taxed as regular income. I have a MBD option at work, so I’m thinking I should cash out a few 10s of Ks each year and max out the MBD, thus eliminating any tax on future gains. 

Are there any issues with this plan? Thanks all!
Let's Determine the Value of Bitcoin
There are two ways to determine the value of something. One is for products, commodities, services, and similar items. The other is for financial instruments. In the first instance, the higher the utility derived from consuming an item, the higher its value. For example. More utility can be derived from a house, a precious metal, or a medical service, than from a tent, a base metal, or a cleaning service. That is why the first is more valuable than the second. Here however we are not interested in determining such value. Bitcoin is not a consumable item but an electronic database record. It belongs to the category of financial instruments because all such instruments are records, either paper or electronic. And in the case of financial instruments, value is determined based on the returns and payments that an instrument provides at maturity, withdrawal or during its market life. Let's now briefly demonstrate what that means by using the most widespread financial instruments - stocks, bonds, and fiat currencies. Then, we will determine the value of Bitcoin.

During the market life of stocks, they pay dividends, while at their withdrawal for buybacks or due to liquidation of a company, they return capital to shareholders. The value here obviously depends on the size of those payments and returns. If a stock issuer can pay higher dividends and return more capital, the value of that stock will be higher, and vice versa. Bonds pay coupons during their market life and return face value at maturity. Here also, if a bond issuer can pay higher coupons and return more face value, the worth of that bond will be higher, and vice versa.

Fiat currencies pay nothing during their market life but they return items before their withdrawal from the market. Namely, after fiat currency units are created by commercial banks granting loans or central banks purchasing government bonds, their beneficiaries collect products, commodities, services, and other items from the market. But as these units represent debt, the beneficiaries are forced to later return such items to the market to get the units for paying that debt. With debt payments, units are withdrawn from the market the same as bonds are withdrawn at maturity and stocks at buybacks or liquidation of companies. The value here depends on the size of the returns. If the beneficiaries can return more items, the value of a currency will be higher, and vice versa.

Now that we know how the value of financial instruments is determined we can turn to Bitcoin. Let's first check for payments during market life. Does the issuer of Bitcoin pay something like coupons or dividends to Bitcoin holders? Well, no. Even in theory, this is not possible given that Bitcoin is issued by a computer program, and not by some legal entity that must pay something. Let's then check for returns at the withdrawal or maturity. Here also, there is nothing to check. Bitcoin has no maturity and it is never withdrawn from the market to return something to its holders. It collects electricity when issued, but it never returns anything. As there are no payments and no returns, we can easily determine that the value of Bitcoin is zero.

But what about all those narratives about Bitcoin's value that circulate on legacy or social media? Well, they are just theories based on the misconception that the value of a financial instrument comes from the technology through which it is exchanged or its limited supply. Namely, given that Bitcoin is easy to transfer, stored and protected in a decentralized manner, immutable, and limited in supply, the story goes that this somehow makes it valuable. But suppose that some stock broker implements the best possible technology for transferring and storing stocks. Would that change the value of these stocks? Would for example Tesla stock become mega expensive because of that? No, that is nonsensical. Such implementation would be unrelated to how much dividend Tesla can pay or how much capital it can return to shareholders. 

Or suppose that shares of a stock of a bankrupt company become limited in supply due to a reverse split. Would that magically make these shares valuable? No, given that the company has zero capital to pay or return something to shareholders. On the other hand, if capital is above zero then the reduction of supply by a reverse split will automatically make shares more valuable. Limited supply affecting the value of a financial instrument presupposes the existence of value. But just having a limited supply and nothing else cannot magically make value to appear. So, just because Bitcoin as a financial instrument (electronic record) is limited in supply that doesn't make it valuable. But people are free to pay a million dollars for Bitcoin just like they can do that for a share of a bankrupt company if they believe in the theory that limited supply can make value to appear. 

A lot of people have invested in Bitcoin and understandably, a myriad of theories emerged about its value, with some of them being pretty weird. People somehow have to rationalize their purchase of a worthless financial instrument. After all, they have to sell it to someone else to return the investments, which forces them to invent or spread various theories about its value. In reality, however, its value has always been, and will always be zero.
Bonds, Bond ETF, and other type bond stuff
With rates hitting so high, and in theory maybe they will drop one day I was thinking of starting to diversify into some bonds or bond ETFs. 

I was wanting to make sure I understand that if I were to buy into a 20+ year ETF bond fund or something like that, if rates go down, the value of the ETF should go up? and while the rate should slowly rise as new bonds are bought at higher rates? 

If i understand that correctly, are there good options and what should I be looking out for? 

That all said, I know there are state bonds that are tax exempt, but when should I focus on those? I do live in a fairly high tax bracket, but most of my income is w-2 and growth stocks. I won't be touching retirement for about 20 years at soonest. So who should be investing in muni / local bonds to avoid taxes. 
The Case for PagBank(NYSE:PAGS)
PagBank(NYSE:PAGS) is a Fintech company focused on consumers , entrepreneurs and merchants varying in size from micro merchants to medium sized companies in brazil.  
PagBank is the only Fintech company in brazil offering a full ecosystem , composed of both individual digital banking services and merchant acquiring, facilitating both consumers and retailers.  
The company was founded in 2006 and became publicly traded on the NYSE at 2018.  
36.8 percent of the company is privately owned by UOL and 63 is publicly traded with a 3.07B market cap.  
The UOL Group CEO and Principal Executive Officer of PagBank Ricardo Dutra,is the former PagBank CEO (2016-2022) is a part of the UOL Group for 26 years and is a MBA.  
The PagBank Ceo  
Alexandre Magnai is the CEO of Pagbank since 2022 and was in the organization since 2015, before that, he spent 15 years at Mastercard leading their latin american regional new business development and retailer issuers initiatives.  
PagBank is the second largest neo bank in brazil,with its client base growing quintuple-fold in the last 4 years,its credit portfolio growing sevenfold,and total deposits growing tenfold.  
Its payment platform grew from 1 to 11 percent market share in the last 7 years,with 354 R$ Billion TPV in 2022.  
In Brazil, only 55% of population 15+ use credit cards, in comparison to Countries like the US,UK and canada with 88% 93% and 97%,therefore the room for growth is very large.  
Pagbank shows consistent growth,with 40% y/y outperforming the industry’s 25%, with e commerce being only 15% of total retail in brazil and PCE expected to reach 70% in 2025, PagBank growth potential is further solidified.  
Since Lula was elected in brazil (January first) brazil 10 Year T Bill Interest Rate went down 13%,inflation rate dropped below 4% for the first time since october 2020 and the brazilian Real went up 10% against the dollar, if the economy continues to go along this trend, brazil spending power will increase and as a result the tpv and revenue of PagBank.  
The newly presented 300 Billion $R PAC initiative is planned to create affordable housing and to advance the economy,and while the full bill wasn't unveiled yet and corruption is a viable concern, the initiative could very well help the company to grow .  
Comparing the key financial ratios of PagBank, to 3 similar companies : Nu Bank(NU),Paypal(PYPL) and Block Inc.(SQ),PagBank has the lowest forward p/e,p/s, p/b, and debt to equity, in addition , it has the second largest net profit margin and largest operational margin.  
The main risk factor in the company is its location,brazil is notoriously corrupt and the current president was involved in corruption scandals before, if brazil economy goes down so does PagBank.
Correlation between WTI price and US SPR refill
When USA sold their reserves of oil when it was expensive, they said they will refill it at price within the range of 67-72$. WTI reached the price of higher 67$ and still they did not refill it. So in order for a company to agree to sell oil for this price, I assume the WTI should be something around 55-65$ for at least a couple of months. 

Do you think that most probably USA knows that at some point WTI will reach this price so they are waiting the right moment, so we should expect this kind of price in the period ahead. Especially it would be good for the Biden's elections if this price happens before the elections in 2024.  

Or do you think that maybe USA do not bother to refill its reserves anytime in the near future?

Does anyone have experience with promissory notes?
Long story short trying to help a friend out who is looking into promissory notes. They are unsecured from what I am understanding but the "promised" rate of return is from 11%-15% depending on the initial investment. Now to me this sounds too good to be true, but they seem fairly certain that this is a solid investment since the company is advertising a near perfect track record. 

&#x200B;

I guess does anyone have any insight on this? Even though they aren't seucred notes are they safe to invest in? I really dont  have much knowledge in this area so if someone could explain to me like im  5 if this is good or bad I would really appreciate it so I can relay that info. 
owning TLT and hedging it with GOLD
If there are expectations that the long term inflation will be more than 3%, that means that the long term yields will rise even further from here, and TLT will fall even more. I suppose this is the assumption at the moments so that's why the 20 year and 30 year yields are around 4,50%.

So if the assumption above is correct, doesn't this meant that the Gold price should go up, and if the assumption is not correct than long term yields will fall and TLT should go up.

So do you think it is a good idea to have both TLT and Gold?
What am I missing about my $10k yolo OTM for SPY puts?
I did the math, and buying SPY puts for $390 and executing at $300 returns $89 million. At first I misread the calculator as $890k, but realized there were extra zeros. Why doesn't everyone do this every two years? You miss usually, but there's a 30% decline in the SPY at least every ten to fifty years. Do you need an account large enough account to collateralize the execution, so $170 million?
7% Mortgage - Pay off early?
Simple discussion:  
  
$400k NW.  
$350k HHI.  
  
Mortgage @ 7% for $525k after 20% down, no PMI.  
  
Shouldn't I throw an extra $10k a month to the house payment and pay off the house within 5-6 years if my mortgage stays at 7%?  
  
What's the pros/cons of putting the extra $10k into QQQ or VTI instead?  
  
If I pay the minimum on the mortgage for 30 years, I'd be paying almost $800k in interest... that's absurd. I plan on keeping the house indefinitely.
Best broker for Australia?
Currently use my bank as a broker. Access to US and Australian markets, and charges 20$ fee when buying and selling, which is a bit of a ripoff imo. My portfolio is only worth around 20,000, so a 40$ fee for each stock kind of hurts. Any recommendations for some good brokers?
When Is It Right To Invest in Cyclicals?
For me, hopefully never! I screen cyclicals out because I don’t believe I can hold a cyclical for ten years, and Buffett said that if he doesn’t think he can hold a company for ten years, he doesn’t buy it. But if I were to buy a cyclical, I wouldn’t buy them when they are offered at alluringly low PE, PB, PS, PEG, etc., because usually at those tempting values, cyclicals are at the peak of their cycle, and reversion could usually be imminent.  
  
What do you think? Is this how you see it too?
How to make sure I am not losing any money when selling a bond ETF?
First of all, sorry for posting this question twice, something strange is happening while formatting the body of the message, it is reformatted after the question is posted.

As far as I understand, bond ETFs:

1. Hold a diverse set of bonds with different maturity dates
2. Don't hold bonds until maturity; instead, they sell bonds before maturity and buy new ones.

Now, when selling such a bond fund, there is a possibility of losing money if interest rates increase. To overcome this, there is a neat strategy: after selling my bond fund holdings, I can either:

1. Buy back all the individual bonds in the ETF and hold them until maturity (which is almost impossible to do).
2. Buy an equivalent amount of bonds with a duration that is equivalent to the average duration of the bond fund. Because the bond market is efficient, the price paid will be more or less the same as in option 1.

The problem is that buying individual bonds is not that easy for a retail investor. That's the reason I am buying a bond ETF in the first place. There are minimum requirements (like a minimum of $50k), spreads can be large, etc.

Are there any other strategies that can be used that are easier to implement? For example, instead of buying individual bonds, buying other types of bond ETFs, etc.?
Cost of capital. I don't know if I understand right...
I started today the study of basic finance concepts, and in the concept of PRESENT VALUE, I encounter the cost of capital. From what I comprehend the cost of capital can be intended as the minimun rate of return to cover the risk of the investment. Am I right?
Are we headed for another 1970s style great inflation?
Historically, I know that in the 70s inflation did a similar thing to today where it felt then bullwhipped right back. 

Recent rise in yields are seeing long duration treasuries in the 4-4.5% range. Add to that the recent uplift in GDP forecasting and the re-acceleration of home purchases, and oil volatility with OPEC continuing production cuts and a war with Russia that doesn’t seem to end that’s constraining supply of commodities comparative to Russia being open to the world. 

How are we not headed for a bullwhip affect forcing a Volcker style response? Someone please prove me wrong because I want to be badly as a heavy investors in bond ETFs.
What is the best broker in Germany?
I've been looking at different brokers and the ones I've found interesting are Etoro, Trade Republic, Scalable and Vanguard Germany. 

However I'm not sure if something like Etoro is a good idea because the money has to be converted to Dollars first causing currency conversion fees.

The other brokers have lots of fees associated with them so can anyone tell me what's the best option? I'm planning on mainly doing long term ETF investing with Cost averaging throughout the years. I also plan to do some middle term individual stock trades.

Thanks in advance
I have about 300K in an employuer based 401K... want to get that into treasury bonds. How?
So I've got about 300K in an employer based 401K that I don't work for anymore.  I hate the bond funds (I'm older) offered and I would really like to get it into 30 year government bonds at 4.5%.    
When I looked up how to do this it said I needed a "set-up a Self-Directed IRA LLC. “Checkbook Control is needed, via the LLC, so you have control over the operations, such as establishing an account at Treasury Direct to purchase T-Bills at auction."  


I have no clue what that means?!  It sounds like I need to set up an LLC... but the 401K is in my name so I'm not seeing how an LLC allows me to do this.  Does anyone else understand this?  

How would one invest in a potential next big city?
I was reading a post on r/geography in which people were discussing which parts of the US could host the next "big" city. Obviously, the responses all centered around climate migrants (Buffalo) and potential shipping  infrastructure (Milwaukee). The arguments made sense. So, how would one invest (see "gamble") on these possibilities? Is there such a thing as region-specific REITs? Is there another angle that could be explored?
ETF, mutual fund, etc that operates like HYSA?
Short situation is: wife & I are saving for house down payment. I have \~20k in a Roth IRA from when I first started working 12ish yrs ago. We've both done great with our 401ks, balance it with roths, etc. Based on routine meetings with CFP we're well ahead of our benchmark for retirement without that IRA of mine, so we **might** want to early withdraw it to tack onto down payment if we can do so without penalty.

Until now the IRA has sat all in total market ETFs. If I could, I'd pull it out and put in a HYSA until use for down payment, but I can't. So, is there an ETF, mutual fund, something like that which basically acts like a HYSA, i.e. guaranteed incremental 4-5% return during times like this when rates are high?

It makes sense to me something like this would exist when rates are high, for people to basically put their money in a HYSA-like situation without pulling the money out of the brokerage account. Does this exist?
I just discovered SPX and NDX
Wow is all I can say. I'm down 20%.
I'm not a rookie trader but I just generally avoided them and then forgot. 
I wish these had no day trade restrictions. Also seems like you buy NDX when you are absolutely sure of a direction. NDX is really big and moves a lot. Seems great to scalp but God can't help you if you time it wrong when your out of day trades and cash to hedge.
How much money should I dump into a 529 at birth?
I’m figuring if investments theoretically double every 7 years, if I drop $10K into a 529 right when my baby is born, it should be somewhere  around $50K by the time he goes off to school, right?

Is there a general rule of thumb if I want to just dump money in now, set it, and forget it?
Why TMF Stands Out: Limited Decay and the Anticipated Rate Cut
The TMF has once again hit a new low following the Treasury sell-off. Have we finally found the bottom, or is there still further to fall?

The question is crucial, but what's even more pressing is this: likely quite soon, the Federal Reserve will cut rates, and as usual, it will be a sharp cut. After that, the TMF is primed to surge to $11-12, and possibly even higher. Therefore, the extent of its dip before the upswing isn't of major concern.

What I appreciate about TMF compared to other leveraged funds is its relatively low daily volatility. This ensures it doesn't decay too rapidly, even when the underlying asset remains stagnant, and yet it still fully capitalizes on a rising trend.

All that remains now is to await the rate cuts. And of course, TMF is capable of starting its upward climb long before the actual rate cuts. Last fall, it surged 62% on expectations alone. This implies that it's better to be positioned even before clear signals from the Fed become visible.
Personal Super Contribution (after tax) vs Salary Sacrifice (RESC)
I am considering doing a $200 per week salary sacrifice to maximise my super for the year and rescue tax.

The question is:
Should I receive my post tax salary ($1064 a week) and make a $200 weekly deposit into my Super as Personal Super Contribution to immediately earn returns (net in hand $864)

OR

Should I ask my employer to make a salary sacrifice and thus make RESC which are deposited quarterly? (net in hand approx 900)

Considerations:
Annual Wage: 70,000 pa
In Hand: $1,064 pw
Living Costs: 600 pw
Estimated annual deductions: $3-3.5k

I am using Signature Super but I plan on switching to Australian Super and once I have a decent deposit, I will transfer to my SMSF and leverage the same to purchase IP (as most people do).

If any other pertinent information is required, can provide.

TIA.
How does Warren Buffet have hoards of cash before a crash?
I don’t know about the recent crashes, but I have heard and seen a few charts where Buffet was sitting on excess of 100 Billion dollars worth of cash. Going through what he says, he wants to invest in a business where the holding period is forever and he only sells when there’s a better price to buy a better business instead of the one he holds. He also says he cannot predict crashes. Contrary to all this, why has he been selling billions worth of stocks and timed it right before a big crash?
How should I (21) begin investing long term? I have no debt, steady job (24$/hr) and live with parents. More detail below
I (m21) make 24/hr, pay about 400/month, and realize I am extremely fortunate to be in this
situation. At this time, I have about 100$ a week (I get paid every week) going into robinhood which is invested into large companies like Microsoft, Nvidia, etc and also into funds like a vanguard ETF s&p 500 fund.
In total with the market how it is, I have about 1650$ in there.
What's the best way to invest long term for an IRA? What are the best apps to be using? 
Should I ditch Robinhood as ive heard/
understood recently that it's not actually investing my money into the actual stocks but to Robinhood instead?
If I set up an IRA should I try to do so with my bank? Or should I be doing it myself?
If anyone has any reliable sources of
information about this kind of stuff it would bebmuch appreciated as I've heard a ton from both sides whenever i try to look this stuff up
Investing in pre-IPO's or IPO's for retail investors?
Are there any companies/services that allow retail investors to get in on pre-IPO's or IPO's? I'm thinking something along the lines of those companies that let you buy a portion of a share of real-estate instead of an entire house? Or better yet direct access (although I doubt this as I assume it's big-money gated).

It's frustrating because in general there are so many good investment opportunities out there but it seems that you need big money to get a chance to the gems early on. 
Employer HSA or self managed?
I qualify for HSA and contribute the max each year pre-tax. We just switched to a new provider that has garbage investment options. We don’t tap into the HSA, rather we accumulate and invest it. We just pay medical out of pocket.

Am I better off self funding after tax my HSA with Fidelity’s that lets me self direct and then deducting the federal and states taxes or stick with pre-tax?

Treasuries at 5% plus now
I just pulled my savings from Apple Savings and half of my stock trades and purchased a 2 year US Treasury at 5%. Wondering if anyone has seen higher than this, or a 6% CD? The other option I was considering was throwing it all on VOO, but i’m mainly doing this because stock votality stresses me out.
Can someone justify the existence of fund managers to me?
I spent the day trawling through a random investment management company (Invesco) looking at all their investment packages. 

Now it's all very sophisticated and operating at a level an amateur never could. Each fund containing 100+ companies, many I've never heard of, I'm sure carefully weighted. ESG considerations, region specific things. Funds focusing on Asia small cap, European mid cap, fixed income markets, investment grade corporate bonds.

The thing is almost every single one of them has performed terribly. Almost none have outperformed the S&P or even come close to it. A lot a down from 10 years ago, specifically the Asian ones. A couple of US equities have very very slightly beat the market, but if you take out management fees I'm not even sure if it wins.

I'm just wondering, what do these people think of themselves? I'm sure they have meetings where they assess their performance. Is there an awkward silence in the room when they show that their fund focused on "long term capital growth" with a 1% management fee is down 10% in the last 10 years? I'm sure they're all on high 6 figure salaries too. Do they look at their job as worthwhile? All they've done is lose money or underperform the market. You can view the profile of the fund manager, all have great credentials and decades of experience... and all for what? To be paid millions to lose people's money?

I'm not even saying they're bad managers, it seems being a manager of a fund focused on Asia has been doomed to failure. And any play that *could* drastically beat the market they probably aren't even allowed to do anyway. 

They all have huge NAV too so there's clearly lots of demand for these 1000 different packages. I wonder where it all comes from. Who is using these? Who looks at "Invesco Belt and Road Bond Fund - A(RMB Hgd) MD -1" and thinks, yes, give me that one.

I'm sure you could say these funds provide benefit by providing capital to many smaller entities but at that point it's just a charity.

I guess i could understand it more if these were all tiny funds that's a very niche corner of the market used by gamblers, but its the complete opposite of that. They're *huge* with billions / trillions of dollars under management. Where does it all come from and why?
Two Questions About Technical Analysis
I know people liken technical analysis to astrology, but, in my humble opinion, technical analysis can give an idea of how “Mr. Market” feels about a company. Basically, when a company is oversold, it means Mr. Market hates it, and when it’s overbought, then Mr. Market is in love with it. Having said that, I’m not a technical investor. I would base 90% of the investing decision on fundamental analysis and only 10% on technical analysis. That’s how I personally see it. But I’m not really an expert, so take what I say with a ton of salt.  
  
If you happen to use technical analysis in your decision-making process, which chart do you use? Do you use the yearly, quarterly, monthly, weekly, or daily? And why do you prefer that time frame?  
  
Finally, which indicators do you think show the overbought and oversold states?
Good idea to invest in multiple s&p500s in one roth IRA?
A couple weeks ago I opened up a Roth IRA with Fidelity. Currently, I am putting a small amount weekly into it and currently have some money in SPY, VOO, and FXAIX, which are all S&p 500s. Should I only focus on one of these? or is it okay to do multple like I am doing now? 
Can we back off our retirement accounts?
Wife (28) and I (31) have been heavily contributing to our 401k, Roth IRA and HSA. 7 years ago (I had a late start) we were making about 110k a year and we are up to about 185k, currently have 320k between all the accounts and were putting 18% into our 401k's not including employer match. We are closing on 6 acres on a lake we paid cash for which will leave us about 25k for an emergency fund. We want to build a vacation home/Air BnB on the lake and are also planning on starting a family next year. Only debt is 184k on our house which we pay $1600 a month for and our cars are paid off and are 3 year old toyotas. By lowering our 401k contributions to 6%, Max Roth IRA and HSA we would still be putting away 36k a year (including employer match). With compounding interest this should be 2.9m in 25 years with a 5% return. Or 30 years at 5% is 4m. We live in the Midwest and would have no debt when we retire. Does this sound ok? So many people here say max 401k no matter what so this feels weird but we really front loaded it and now will have extra expenses. Also not to be a doomer but the economy is making me feel uneasy so a bigger cushion would lower my stress in the case of me getting laid off, wife is a nurse so she is probably safe.
For Anyone Who is Long/Generally Interested in Sea Ltd. (SE)
**Intro:** 

\[Very brief\]  
  
If you are long SEA I’m sure you saw the horrendous drop this morning on the news of them coming in light on revenue expectations. I personally feel like this drop is completely overblown and management’s ability to emphasize profitability and add to their cash pile over the last two quarters shows great discipline and flexibility in a changing market. They even profitably grew e-commerce by \~21% YOY and digital payment by \~50% YOY.   
  
I did a conservative sum of the parts analysis this morning where I compared SE’s three segments to comparable companies to show where a potential bottom could be and to hopefully help investors (myself) not panic sell due to this overblown move. I used P/S ratios because I don’t think EBITDA or earnings are entirely meaningful yet in the company’s current stage. **I also used a run rate for 2023 and did not assume any further growth, as to be as conservative as possible in forming the base case.**   
  
**Summary:**   
  
**Garena:**   
  
Scenario 1 - Steady State: Comparing Garena to Tencent’s P/S ratio on a 2Q23 annualized basis, so assuming no growth for the rest of 2023 but keeping the same run rate, the valuation for Garena should be \~$5.5B.   
  
Scenario 2 - P/S Comp Reduction Slashed by 50% due to Continual Decline (Ultra Conservative): Using the same assumptions as above, the value of Garena would be \~$2.7B. I believe this is ultra conservative because as we saw today, overall gaming metrics are starting to improve i.e. MAUs and % of paying users, and I think with the new title launches, should continue into future quarters.   
  
**Shopee:**   
  
Using the run rate for 2023, so again, assuming no growth, the value for Shopee is \~$14B  
  
**Sea Money:**   
  
Using the run rate for 2023, so again, assuming no growth, the value for Sea Money is \~$1.9B. I believe this is extremely conservative. I don’t think the comps (PYPL, STNE) quite capture the growth and opportunity of Sea Money due to the rapid growth and high growth region, as the P/S average used was \~2. Fintech has been under pressure recently, but historic P/S comps have ranged from 6 to 12, so if you do the math, the valuation here is much higher on a realistic basis.   
  
**Conclusion:**   
  
On a straight across basis, assuming Garena (and the other segments) keep the current run rate for the year, the valuation of the sum of the parts is \~$21B. Cutting the multiple in half for Garenas decline gives us \~$18B.   
  
That being said, these valuations assume no additional growth in the other segments, simply keeping the current run rate. That being understood, I think where it’s sitting now at $23B could be argued to be the fair price/intrinsic value, which would make sense in an efficient market.  
  
**Personal Thoughts:**  
  
It’s gut wrenching to watch a company drop like SE did today, but it’s important to table emotions and remember the game you’re playing. SE operates in a market that is going to see continual and immense growth for decades to come, well above the GDP growth % for most of the developing world. They have strong market leadership in e-commerce and even with entrants like TikTok, can still materially grow that business year over year due to low overall e-commerce market penetration.   
  
As discussed in the call, they’re also pivoting back into a growth mode for Shopee as to keep up with competitors in the region. This should boost the Shopee revenue growth rate as well as capture more sellers/buyers in the Sea Money ecosystem, providing a two-fold growth engine.   
  
I personally am going to hang tight with my 50% paper loss and wait for a lower price to add to my position (as crazy \[or not\] as that sounds). If it went any lower from current levels, especially as low as \~$18B I would see this as a clear opportunity to invest heavily, especially as the region is expected to recover in 2024 and beyond and as discussed above, I believe the gaming segment is going to continue to stabilize through the EOY.   
  
Would love to know what everyone’s thoughts are, whether long or short. GLTA.  
  
**TL;DR** \- SE is down but certainly not out. A great company that had expectations set too high in the short/medium term, but has a great growth story laid out in front of it.   

The Atlanta Fed's GDPNow estimate for Q3 now at 5.0% growth
https://twitter.com/AtlantaFed/status/1691498747060953096

Bidenomics continues to thrive. The question is: will consumer sentiment finally catch up with the reality that the economy is, in fact, quite healthy, or will everyone continue believing the economy is doing poorly until prices fall back to pre-COVID levels (or wages increase substantially)?

Perhaps more importantly, how will doomers dismiss yet another signal that a recession really isn't imminent?

Should I have a taxable account?
Hello, I am wondering if I should bother having a taxable account if I am not able to max out my Roth IRA and HSA every year? I invest in both, but I do not make enough to be able to max them out at the end of the year. With this in mind, would it be wise to even consider a taxable account until I make enough to invest more than the maximum that those accounts offer? Or should I still be building a taxable account with a small portion of my investment allocations? 

I have heard that it would be essentially a loss in the long run if I am getting taxed on money that could have been otherwise put in a tax-savings account. But on the other hand I am wondering if I am missing out on taking advantage of funds that I could use before I reach the age of being able to withdraw from the Roth IRA and HSA accounts. Any advice?
Do capital losses carryover with ACAT transfer?
I had some investments with M1 which had depreciated since I purchased them. Now, I've done an ACAT transfer of those investments over to Schwab. Schwab does not appear to have any history of gains or losses for those investments prior to the transfer. If I sell those investments now, will the capital losses (since the initial purchase) be reflected on my Schwab statements for tax purposes? Will they be reflected on my M1 statement? Or do I need to manually track them?
Best Overall Money Market Accounts Considering Taxes
I'm in the USA and I was reading that some money market accounts are "tax exempt" or pay a lower tax rate than others.  I'm wondering if anyone knows the rate at which money market profits are generally taxed?  Then, are there money market accounts out there that have a high yield and are also tax exempt or even a lower tax rate?  If so, what are they?    


Thanks for any help. 
What about the upcoming SPGC IPO?
There are many discussions on Reddit about IPOs in general. These are usually focusing on companies going public for the first time.  
  
[SPGC](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/ipos/overview?dealId=1227012-103809) is a very different story. This is a technology-forward golf company, with a growing portfolio of golf products, including putting instruments, golf shafts, golf grips, and other golf-related products. In April 2022, in consideration of their growth opportunities in shaft technologies, they expanded their manufacturing business to include advanced premium golf shafts by opening a new shaft manufacturing facility in St. Joseph, MO.   
  
Let's talk about this opportunity. What's people's sentiment about this IPO? What's considered a fair unit price? What's the market sentiment about this company? What are the options to get into this IPO?
Good brokerage for fractional buying?
I only recently started my investing journey, and chose Schwab as my brokerage. However, I hate that I can’t buy fractional shares of anything except certain stocks on there. 

I want to invest monthly into things, like SCHD and VOO to name a few, but obviously I can’t just put $100 or whatever into each one since Schwab can’t do fractional stuff. I know Robinhood let’s you do that, but I also know that platform is usually not advised for real investing. 

I know Vanguard allows fractional stuff, but only for it’s own funds so SCHD would still not be eligible for fractional buying. So I want to know what platform is safe and trustworthy, but also that accepts fractional investing on all ETFs and mutual funds (if one exists).

Thank you in advance for any help!
Which is better, creating your own diversified fund or buying funds (index or actively managed)?
I can create by own fund by buying the stocks of companies I trust and able to decide my own ratios based on personal risk tolerance. When it comes to funds, someone else is basically taking care of your money. 

I am educated enough to put in my own research to chose stocks or funds that works best for me. But do you think I am overthinking it and I should simply invest with a fund instead of investing too much of my time?
How many ETFs is too many?
So, my investment strategy is split between Crypto and Stocks of companies from my country. (I also have a private pension account opened with a pension management fund that I have been contribuiting for ober 28 months.) I am 25 years old.

Recently I decided to diversify a bit and also add index ETFs into my portfolio with another broker.

I have made a shortlist of 6 ETFs so far, but can't really decide if I should focus on only 1 or more.

The ETFs that I selected are:

VWCE.de
VVSM.de
2B76.de
XDW0.de
XDWT.de
XAIX.de

So, how many ETFs is too many? Is this just wasting potential ROI? Is it too diversified? Should I also add bonds? Am I regarded?
Looking for advice to rebalance my wife's employee stock accounts
Hello Investing Community.Getting burnt is great for learning :) I learned a lot in my not-so-short life.My wife worked at two tech companies and had a good ride. The last one was Microsoft. She rode the gravy train. (explainer, she first got shares allocated, hiring bonus and purchased the maximum quantity of shares allowed which is 10% of her monthly income, she never sold any of her shares) I aim to balance her portfolio to align with her risk profile.

How do I go about it? How do I best explain it to her? I would like to draw a risk pyramid and I would love it for her to make the decision. Are there any great tools out there in regards to best explaining to an inexperienced investor who got very lucky?

Thank you!
At What Ratio Do You Add Money to Your Portfolio?
Recently, I came across a reasonably large sum of money, and I'm wondering how I should add it to my portfolio. I've found nothing on the internet on this topic so I guess I'll ask it here. My target allocation is 80/20 stocks/bonds however currently my portfolio is about 90/10. 

Should I

1. Invest the money with the current ratio of my portfolio (90% going in stocks and 10% in bonds)
2. Invest 80% in stocks and 20% in bonds
3. Or invest highly disproportionately in bonds to bring my entire portfolio's ratio back to 80/20  
Why is a mix of passive and active management not typically recommended?
Hypothetically, if all investors suddenly allocated exclusively to index funds, market cap proportions within an index would never change, and all stock prices within the index would change by an equal percentage.

The market needs some form of “active” management, through purchases of individual securities, for prices to respond individually (by unequal proportions) to earnings and industry events.

Given this logic (which might be flawed to begin with - let me know), wouldn’t it make sense for investors to allocate some portion of a portfolio to actively managed funds? I’m on board with index funds as the gold standard, but if I take the concept of "indexing is best" to its logical conclusion, I'm left thinking there is some value within active management that investors would be missing by indexing.
A decline in the big four's auditing quality stokes fears of an Enron-style corporate collapse

Who Are Your Investment Heroes?
As the title asks, who are your investment heroes? From whom have you learned the most about investing? From whom have you learned the least?

My #1 hero is a not-widely-know author named Ralph Vince. His first book, titled *Portfolio Management Formulas*, taught me about leverage. A little leverage can be a good thing but too much can be counterproductive — you have to find the sweet spot. This cultivated my appreciation for 2x leveraged index funds such as QLD (2x NASDAQ 100) and SSO (2x S&P 500). Several people have studied 3x funds on extended data sets and have found they actually underperform 2x in bull and bear markets and 2x funds are thus the better long-term hold. I have had leveraged index funds since 2017 and the results have been very rewarding.

\#2 Is Jack Bogle, who popularized the index fund.

\#3 Is J.L. Collins. I like his straightforward style, especially on how to deal with down markets.

\#4 Warren Buffet. He candidly states that it was a different ball game when he and Charlie Munger were picking stocks in the 1950's. He tells people that nowadays the lay investor should concentrate on index funds and not try to be Buffett and Munger. Smart. I like his candor in that regard.

PEOPLE I CAN'T STAND

Peter Lynch. He advocates the outmoded paradigm of picking individual stocks. His smug-ass self tells people, "everyone can do well in the stock market". **BULL F\*\*\*ING SHIT!!!** Never mind that over 90% of managed mutual funds fail to meet or exceed index returns over 20+ years according to SPIVA data. Tell me how facile it is, Peter. I bought his book many years ago and it went right back to the book store. The book is full of froth and Peter bragging on himself, about how he "discovered" Dunkin Donuts and Hanes. Peter actually uttered the following: "never buy stocks that go down". Yes, he actually said that. OK, Peter, I'll get out my Ouija board and ask it if a stock will go down. Or I might ask my magic 8-ball.

[Bogleheads.com](https://Bogleheads.com). A lot of screwy financial and investment information there, but right or wrong they KNOW they're right. Always. In addition, the board has Nazi-like management, especially one moderator in particular who is on a Texas-sized power trip.

There is one YouTuber who doesn't know what the f\*\*k he's talking about, but has deluded himself into thinking he does. He merely repeats what he has been brainwashed into thinking without applying any common-sense validity testing. I'll spare him any humiliation by not identifying him.

Who are your investment heroes and non-heroes?
Most reliable broker that permits wider pre/after hours trading?
Fidelity failed at a critical juncture today. I like Fidelity overall, but dang, for them to fail at the time that they did today is inexcusable.

So my question is, which broker communicates with tradingview, allows the full range of pre/after hours trading, and can be relied upon to not fail at \~2:45 thru 3:40 pm Eastern?
When bonds go bad. What actually happens?
I’m curious if anyone has bought a bond from a large institution like vanguard or fidelity and then the bond went bust, what communication or information do you receive? Does the bond show on your account as a negative, meaning you invested $10k and then it just shows $0. Do you get an email or letter explaining what happened? Or do you still have a chance to collect some principal?
Hello, I am 15 years old, I want to get into investing and earning money. How do I start?
How much money do I need(£)? What app/website should I invest in? If there are other better ways to make money online then you can recommend me that. Am I too young too start? hank you for helping in advance (If you do).

How much money do I need to start. Are there any courses/books that I should take.
If you can deduct losses from taxes, does that mean your risk tolerance increases as you pay more taxes?
Of course you don't want to go into investing with the intention of losing as money not earned is equivalent to money lost. Individuals who may need liquidity in the short term (entrepreneurs or business owners) can be forced to "accept" lower returns in the form of a bond ladder with short maturity rates.

However if your income is large (and thus you pay lots of income tax, say 20k last year) in theory you could move 20k you'd otherwise have in a bond ladder to an ETF. If you happen to need liquidity when the market has taken a downturn, just sell enough of your holdings at a 20k loss and deduct from taxes. It's not ideal, but you retain the upside of potential liquidation at market upturns without having to take a loss at a downturn.


Does that make sense?
Which evil/unethical companies do you invest in?
In the past I looked into some prison stocks but never bought.

I hope those companies are heavily regulated since the recipe for abuse is there.

If you considered a company unethical would you still invest in it if you thought it could make you some money?
Better platform for european stocks?
I have been using IKBR for all my investing, but they take a 3 euro commission every time for european stocks. I invest in very small amounts so that 3 can be very annoying. Is there better platforms that I can buy european stocks on and then move said stocks to IKBR without paying anything? Or do people usually have 2 or more brokers who they they invest with? 
Opportunity that I think could be interesting
I'm always looking for new investments. 

Recently I had an issue with my plumming so my plummer came over and fixed my house up. As we were talking I mentioned I saw his office/trucks and it was a good location. He said it was, but was too small. He also said a building is for sale right now and it would be perfect for his needs (parking, workshop, offices) but that its price of $1.8m was too hefty because of what the mortgage would be.


I didn't say anything in the moment, but it seems like this could be a good opportunity to partner. I could provide capital to buy the building for a stake in his company.


What do folks here think about this type of thing? I don't want to be involved operationally. I'd be a pure money partner. I'm sure there are many ways to structure it. Just looking to diversify and I also have to believe if I became a partner then perhaps I can take advantage of the tax benefits of owning a small business too?
Company Stock Options After Layoffs Help
Hello,

My company (private) just had a round of layoffs and they vested our stock options with the opportunity to exercise them for up to 2 years from our termination date.

My question is.. if the company gets acquired (which has been an ongoing rumor), would we still be able to exercise the stock options or would it be up to the acquiring company to decide?

Is this common practice? I am trying to figure out if I should exercise my options now or hold out until some actual news but I'm concerned about risking not being able to exercise my options.

I am fairly new to company stocks and would appreciate any insights! Thanks!
Planning what to do when money market yields eventually go down
Are there any correlations or patterns for how stocks perform when money market yields go up or down a lot?

I just opened a taxable brokerage account with the intent of long term (20 years) but 80% of it is earning 5+% in a money market. Eventually that is going to dry up so it would be nice to know there is a correlation with stock/etf prices so I can plan on what to expect. 

If stocks go up, then maybe I should move now? Of if they usually go down, that would be a better time.or is it all random?
Do You Buy a Stock When Its Operating Margin Is in Decline for Five to Ten Years?
Personally, I avoid such stocks, and I get puzzled when I see some fund managers buy stocks whose operating margin has been trending down for five or ten years.  
  
Am I missing something here?  
  
What about you? Do you buy a stock when its operating margin is in decline for five to ten years?
How do you allocate asset classes across different taxable and retirement accounts?
If you had the following:  
1.  inherited IRA that you were required to take RMDs from and you are planning on taking the minimum required from there every year  
2. a Roth IRA  
3. a Traditional IRA that you are not required to take RMDs from  
4. A normal individual taxable account  
How would you try to allocate ETFs for domestic stocks, international stocks, domestic bonds and international bonds in those accounts if you were looking for a 90% stock and 10% bond allocation if you were just saving for retirement in a few decades?  (US stocks being 54%, International Stocks being 36%, US bonds being 7%, and International bonds being 3% of the portfolio)  
I think that you would want the roth IRA to be 100% either domestic or international stocks because you would want to take advantage that gains from that account were not taxed when you withdraw them and have that grow as much as possible.  Try to have it at 60% domestic stocks and 40% international so your risk is spread across those two asset classes.    
I think you would want to have the inherited IRA with the largest allocation of either domestic or international stocks that your strategy allows because you want to have the money grow as much as possible before you are required to withdraw it.    
I think you would want to try to maintain the traditional IRA at some split of equities and bonds so you can rebalance there without making a tax liability. Maybe 50:50 of the value split between stocks and bonds, or more because you will likely have to sell stocks and buy bonds in the future because stocks grow more.    
Finally, you use the individual account to balance your portfolio according to your strategy and buy as many stocks and bonds that you need to meet the target allocations I mentioned above.    
Is my thinking sound here?    

Will passive index investing ever stop working?
Outside my emergency fund, my investment portfolio is 100% VBIAX (60/40 balanced portfolio). I have been blindly putting money into this account on a monthly cadence. 

The only thing that has ever registered with me regarding wealth management is that passive indexing works. But the only question here is: “will it continue to work indefinitely?” 

Passive indexing wouldn’t have been great in UK and Japan. Why is America (and SP 500) different?
How come whatever position I try to sell on IBKR and check the preview it always gives me the same total $30 as the post amount after transaction?
I also see that my buying power is only $30
dollars while the actual cash is around $500. I don't have any open orders neither to buy or sell, but I did buy and sell (WE) in the past few days.
My account supposedly doesn't tallow margin or short selling as per what I read when I first opened it, so what happened?
Do you have a single source of truth for EFT/MF Breakdowns across asset class, geography, industry, and market size? Am I overthinking this?
I have been working on simplifying and clearly defining my investment strategy. Part of that is to have target allocations percentages across asset class, geography, industry, and market size. Is there a place you look to easily access this information?

The challenge I am running into (using COSIX as an example:

* [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/COSIX/holdings?p=COSIX)
   * Under Holdings Tab
      * States 88.68% bonds
      * 95.08% Energy Industry
      * US and International Bonds and Notes.
   * Under Profile Tab
      * Small Value companies (Morningstar Category)
* [COSIX Report](https://www.ta-retirement.com/fund_sheet/fund375.pdf)
   * Medium Moderate companies (Morningstar Category)
   * 87.7% bonds
   * Gov (6.04%), Corporate (49.04%), Securitized (25.96%), Other (3.3%)
* Key Gaps between Yahoo Finance and the Report
   * Discrepancy in industry allocations
   * Market Size Focus (Small/Value vs Medium/Moderate)
   * What is the breakdown between International and US

Please let me know if there is a resource you use as the source of truth to find all this information easily. I am using COSIX as an example, but I would like to obtain this information for many ETFs and Managed Funds, so it would be efficient to use one tool to obtain all the key info. I will use this to start a balanced portfolio, and rebalance every so often.

If you disagree with this approach or if you feel that I am overthinking/analyzing, please let me know how you approach your investment strategy. Thank you in advance!
Used portfolio visualized and am stumped…am I totally off?
Can someone suggest a good starting and ending year to get results other than what I got? I’m sure there are such starting and ending years…and I’m playing with it more….

https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-asset-class-allocation


I used portfolio analyzer and made 3 portfolios. 

1 - 100% US stock market
2 - 100% EX-US
3 - 100% US large cap growth

Started with $500 and every month contributed $500 starting in my starting year (I kept increasing starting year by 1 to see how they performed). 

It works starting 1986 even if you select 1972 (graph starts in 1986) 

My ending portfolio balance was always higher for portfolio 3 (QQQ is it?). Then portfolio 2 (VTI) and then portfolio 1 (VXUS). 

I still have to play with ending years - am I totally looking in the wrong direction?

Edit: outcome is almost the same if I start in 1997 and end in 2011. $90k contributed and end with approx $120k after 13 years. 

Gonna continue playing
Need help choosing a bond fund
After plenty of research, I am rebalancing my portfolio to be more in-line with the boglehead philosophy. I use Fidelity as my brokerage account (this may not be important), and I am having trouble choosing a "Total Bond Fund". 

Any suggestions for a good fund, or how I can research them further to make the right choice for me?

Anyone has an opinion on Turbos ?
Hello,

I've been looking at turbos for a new asset to add to my portfolio. I've wanted something more active with leverage, I'm ready and able to take some moderate risks and I  have decent knowledge of the market. **Does anyone have an opinion or an experience with them? Is it a good asset to have some leverage and boost a bit my capital?** I was obviously planning on only using it for a small portion of my capital. 

(I'm in the EU if that helps and have sufficient time on a day to day basis to manage my investment)

Thanks
selling bond etfs to buy current rate treasury bonds or current etfs ?
I had ended up purchasing some bond etfs (municipal and state tax exempt) a few years ago. I see they are down almost 9%. Does it make sense for me to sell those, take a capital loss that i can claim for the next few years may be, and buy the treasury bonds at a much more attractive interest rate?

I hadn't quite understood much about bonds earlier and was just following the age old advice of split your investments in stocks+bonds. 

And still trying to understand it the above strategy makes sense, or will the bond etfs I have go up in value as interest rates go down anyway and won't make much of a difference. I understand i am paying the etf expense ratio for the convenience of being able to pull out the money when i need. 
Investing in Foreign Bonds

Investors, 

I'm an American living in Korea, age 33. I'm exploring financial options like getting an index fund started through interactive brokers. (There are better ones, but these guys are the only ones accepting Korean Won into other currencies) 

In the meantime I'm also trying to invest long term in foreign bond markets, for Old Me. Due to me living out here, my options are stymied because I'm not a citizen and the Korean Won doesn't really play well with others...

I feel I shouldn't grab any Yankee Bonds because of the high interest rates, so I'm thinking about Arirang Bonds or Samurai Bonds. I haven't done much research into this, beyond a few links from investopedia. Before I invest some chips, im hoping for Second and Third opinions. 

I have a 2yr foreign savings account from won to USD with an exchange bank, it takes ₩1,000,000 every month from my income. I still have about ₩600,000 left after expenses and food. Its just coffee money, so I should do something meaningful with it. Any constructive advice is appreciated!
How to determine value in small cap/newer companies?
So I’ve recently stumbled upon Jupiter Wellness. Started trading publicly in 2020, 25 million market cap, negative earnings but 50%+ year over year growth in revenue. 

They are a health and wellness research team and I see potential in a sunscreen they are making that protects against jellyfish stings, as well as a merger with a company that is making a drink that rapidly reduces alcohol levels in the system. I work in spirits and the second one has the chance to grow into a $100 million a year brand. Buuuut….

Any advice on how to look at small cap companies like this from a numbers standpoint to help make a better decision, or is it purely speculative this early on and just rolling the dice ?
Investing 100k cautiously in this market.
I've been slacking on getting better about investing for the last few years as my salary has increased.  I have been maxing Roth IRA and contributing up to match on 401k(I'm thinking about maxing this as well).  I have about 136k in retirement accounts.

I'm at the point where I know I'm just being triggershy and losing money/time so I need to make some decisions.

I have around 140k in cash which is just getting eaten into by inflation and I'm not currently using a high yield savings account.

I'm tentatively planning on moving 40k to a HYSA as an emergency fund, it's a bit more than 6 months of expenses but I'm in tech and the sector is kind of unstable right now.

I've been thinking of just putting the rest in VTI/VSUX and letting it sit(I'm 37) - I shouldn't need it until retirement, and then contributing any income above what I need to keep that emergency fund around ~40k as it comes in.

I'm a little apprehensive as I read a lot of concerns about a recession but I also understand the argument for time in the market vs timing the market.

I don't have any debt other than my mortgage and make a little over 200k.  I realize this is a pretty high income, and it might seem ridiculous asking for advice, but I am also pretty concerned about layoffs in the tech sector and a potentially long stint of unemployment if we see a 2000s style bubble bursting.

Does this sound like a reasonable plan?
VOO vs SSO- which one is good for long term investment?
I need to find some good ETF for long term investment.  I am planning to put money in on monthly basis but don’t know which ones are good ones. I found VOO and invested very little so far but then someone close to me  suggested SSO. SSO doesn’t look good in long term as per its past performance. I am not good at investing and don’t know how to interpret its data so wondering if anyone has any suggestions.
Thank you in advance.
Is it worth investing in 457b plan if you already have a government pension and maxing out Roth IRA?

I currently have a 457b getting 13% ROI in a couple aggressive growth funds over past 5 years. $75k salary and contribute $400/mo to it. No employe match or anything. Potential financial advisor reviewed investments/portfolio for retirement planning and recommended stop funding 457b. Instead recommended an American Fund for my Roth.

Retirement target is about 17 years and will likely be in same tax bracket in retirement.
What is cost of repatriation?
So just reading through the fine print on some trading platforms i.e etoro/trading212 to understand the risks involved in using these. I'm Finding it a common theme that your stocks do not have the same level of protection as your money would in a bank. However, I have come across this sentence "your losses are restricted to the cost of repatriation of funds only" What exatly does this mean for an investor in the unlikely event of one of these companies going bust.
There's a lot of overlap between VOO and VUG, but...
Would it still make sense to invest in both of them, assuming that down the road, today's famous tech stocks will no longer be the top OVERALL stocks? I don't think that Apple, Alphabet, Meta, and NVIDIA will claim the throne forever, and so having both VOO and VUG under your belt might be a way to hedge yourself against their eventual decline. Or should I just stick to VOO? 
Thinking of putting 60% of my net worth in the S&P 500
I'm a recent graduate with a full time job and my parents are pretty well off financially. But its nothing ridiculous. They have been supportive of me financially as well growing up and I've had a bank account with a small allowance that I never really indulged with because it was my understanding it was theirs not mine. 

Well they told me I could do whatever with the money now that I have a job and I'm debating putting close to 60% in the S&P 500, dollar cost averaged over the next 12-18 months. My own job doesn't pay a lot, but I figured that this would be the head start I need, which would be about $70,000 combining my own money with theirs considering I already don't touch it. I read the intelligent investor and I think it's a good idea. I know because I'm young I should be riskier but I know barely anyone beats the S&P 500 over a long period of time. It would only leave about a 6 month emergency fund left in savings.

Any thoughts? I'm 23.


EDIT 08/14/23 : Thank you for so many well thought out responses, i really appreciate it! On another note for future commenters, please read my full post before doing so.

 A lot of people didn't read and are hating on me for trying to dump it all at once which I clearly state I wasn't going to do.

Stock Score System Reliability
Has anyone actually benefitted from any of the stock scoring systems (Paid like VectorVest, TipRanks, Morningstar or unpaid like stockinvest.com)? Or is it all just fluff with scores that don’t correlate with how a stock performs? If you have had success with one or think one is reliable, which one is it?

I know doing your own research is best, but sometimes it’s nice to have an additional matrix to compare with that considers things you may not be aware of.
Bank Just Did Me a Favor!
I had a brokered CD with Vanguard.  It carried an interest rate of 3.6% and was due to mature in another 2 years.  It was also callable, and strangely enough the bank called it today.  So I opened a 2 year, non-callable CD with a different bank  at 5%.

Obviously good for me, but any idea why the bank would call it?  I always assumed it would only be called if interest rates were declining.
"Russia says it will halt foreign currency purchases and launch a digital ruble to keep the currency from spiraling further". I don't see how.
Y!Finance article: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/russia-says-halt-foreign-currency-000144351.html

Does "Launching a Central Bank Digital Currency" **really** stabilize that currency's value?  One comment says, *"A digital ruble is even more worthless than a regular ruble."*, which completely contradicts the title.

Is this something that applies only to countries like Russia with a low-value currency to start with, or would it have the same impact with USDollar or SwissFranc?  I don't get it.
Does it make sense to take advantage of high guaranteed rates and wait for the fed to drop the rate?
Moving this post from wall street bets.

If you had a sizable amount of money 100k+ would you wait for the fed to lower the rate to invest?

I am thinking take advantage of high cd or bond rates and investing in the stock market when the fed lowers the rate sometime next year (or beyond).

Any help is appreciated. It feels like the tech side of ai growth is cooling and the benefits of companies taking advantage of ai productivity tools could take a while to mature.

CD rates are at 5%. When will we see that again?

Any thoughts appreciated.
Help, I don't know where to go from here.
I'm 19 and I have 10k saved up.  
  
Boring stuff: Worked in a tesla factory right out of HS in another town for a year. Left that and came back to my hometown to try college while working partime. I still have to pull out the 401k but that's till the end of this month because I need to wait 2 paycheck periods. I have a fidelity account but nothing else.  
  
Any and all advice is appreciated. Thank you.
How to identify a strong moat?
Hello guys. 

I recently informed myself about the cementproducing industry and I found out that the market leader is Holcim. Just because Holcim is the market leader doesn't mean they have a strong moat, right?

There is as an example one interesting participants called Buzzi which is growing stronger and seemingly increasing marketshare. Buzzi got a higher ROIC and profitmargin which seems for me that management is doing a better job investing their money.

So my question is, how to identify a strong moat?
Restrictions on GBP/EURO bonds
I have EURO and GBP in my Interactive Brokers account in cash.  
I'm researching bonds in those denominations. I see that there is a field in the bond information titled "Unavailable in the US or to US persons unless exempted by the SEC", and all the GBP/Euro bonds I've tried have 'Yes' for that field.  
I am a European citizen by nationality, but I am a US person and US resident. Does that mean that I cannot purchase said bonds? In principle, should I be legally allowed and, if so, is there a way to do it and can I get IB to let me do it through their platform?
Interest rates should stay around 5% for longer — even as inflation falls, top economist Jim O’Neill says
[https://www.cnbc.com/2023/08/10/veteran-economist-jim-oneill-says-interest-rates-should-stay-around-5percent-for-longer.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/08/10/veteran-economist-jim-oneill-says-interest-rates-should-stay-around-5percent-for-longer.html)

&#x200B;

It looks like the Fed might nudge rates up by a quarter point in September, but the real action could be a rate cut in 2024, as per CME Group's crystal ball. O'Neill's got a point – aiming for around 5% rates makes sense for keeping inflation in check and stability.
HYSA vs Money Market Fund
I'm just curious about what your thoughts are on HYSA vs Money Market Funds. In my case the HYSA is 4.65% while MMF is 5.27%. Could a MMF be used as a savings for my extra cash for that higher rate or should I just keep it in the HYSA for safety and being able to withdraw immediately? 
About business strategies
In the last few years there were a lot of articles on McDonald's about expanding their business model. They started to buying real estate in the whole world and now they make most of their earnings through real estate.

Other Companies adopted, expanded or switched their strategy too. Either for external reason and some for internal ones. Most of them are pretty reasonable in hindsight, but were innovative when introduced. For example:

* Apple expanded from hardware to service ecosystem
* Apple switched from just buying chips to designing them (peak with the M-series)
* obviously, Netflix changed from physical copies to streaming
* when the clothing industry went heavy on offshoring in the 90's (?)
* US Digital companies optimized their business through tax optimization (in EU through Ireland)
* Surprisingly the industry in the agricultural sector is leading in many new innovations like autonomous driving/automation with leaders like Deere.

My question is, where can i find more information about this? Are there any good books, documentaries, videos etc. you can recommend? 

What are strategies, which impressed you or you find really remarkable? There are so many big and smalls companies out there and you guys are all very curios and analytic :) and yes i'm aware this is a really open question with so many possible aspects.

Thanks for your support. English is not my mother tongue so pardon my mistakes.

$50,000 in Acorns, should I switch to Schwab?
I have been saving money into the Acorns app basically since the app came out so I still have the legacy fee of $1/month. My account is at $50,000 and I am wondering if I should roll that money into a Schwab brokerage account because I hear you can make more money in the long run that way rather than Acorns. The reason I started using Acorns was for ease of use but I feel like $50,000 is enough where I can take the time to research and invest better. What are your thoughts?
Any of you invested in BRK A or B?
I’m thinking of throwing my M1 portfolio entirely into a 50/50 split of A and B just for shigs, it’s my play account.  If I played my budgeting cards right this month I’ll have around $5,000 to put in Sept. 1st(yes, Roth is maxed already).  Any constructive criticism of Mr. Buffett or things that throw warning bells about Berkshire for any of you?
Dollar Cost Avg into VOO and IXUS or VOO and ETH
Hi all,

Rather new to all of this but recently started a new job that boosted my income and allows me to actually have money left over to save and invest in addition to making 401K contributions.

I started tossing about $300 a month into RH and going 50/50 on VOO and IXUS. Is this a good set it and forget it vehicle or am I better off going w/ VOO and ETH? Or perhaps some other ideas to research? I don't have any plans for this money, really just want to see how far I can build it up and I expect to increase the $300 a month amount at some point once my liquid emergency savings acct has reached adequate levels.

Anyways I'd love some insights, thanks!
Investing in robinhood ira?
Im looking to make a retirement account at 20 y/o and from what I’ve compared and seen is robinhood a good go to for a roth ira? It’s recommending me BND, VEA, IVV, VWO, VONG, IJR, and SPMO as my main stocks that will go into the portfolio along with a 1% match on what I put in with little/no fees from what I see. I have 1400 in regular stocks with most of it being VOO but I’m definitely still new to all of this and can’t necessarily afford a financial advisor.
U.S. National Debt and Default
I hope this is the right place to put this, but I have a few questions about the US national debt. I'm not a US citizen, but a number of my investments are located in the US. More importantly the US national debt has skyrocketed over the decades and continues to grow, what will people believe will happen in the future? A default? Some massive restructuring? It doesn't seem like a good outcome could occur.   


Of course I could be (and I pray that I am) wrong, but I'd like to hear peoples opinions on the matter.
Education expense questions
Hi. I have two daughters 13 and 7. Started late investing bcs I wasn’t educated enough previously. I’ve been investing in 529 for my 7 year old about 2400 per year for 2 years already. But for my 13 year old I have 25k in I bonds. I started I bonds investing when it was attractive. My 13 year old will be graduating from high school at the age of 18 and I have a lot of assets plus my income is high which affects her financial aid or anything in that regard. Time flies, she will be 18 soon. What else should I do to help her?

Higher Interest Rates means more profit for banks....no?
My banks EPS have dropped about 7% even though the interest rates have increased.  I was under the impression that higher rates allowed the banks to make more money.  what am I missing here.  Also, I like using EPS as a year over year comparison to figure out if my companies are doing a good job.  I'm sure people here have better ways so I'm all ears on that.  Thanks in advance for  the input.
Penn spent some $550 million on Barstool Sports. Dave Portnoy got it back for $1.
Penn anticipates recording a 'pre-tax non-cash loss' of $800 million to $850 million due to the transaction. In February 2020, Penn Entertainment Inc., a casino and online betting firm, acquired a 36% share in Barstool Sports for $161 million. Subsequently, this year, Penn purchased the remaining stake for $388 million. However, recent news reveals that Penn has sold the well-known sports and pop-culture website back to its founder, Dave Portnoy, for a nominal amount of $1.

Tax loss harvesting, am I doing it correctly?

I have AMZN stocks purchased more than a year ago at 100k$ and are now worth 150k$

I have ARKK stocks purchased more than a year ago at 20k$ and are now worth 5k$

I want to sell all my ARKK and enough AMZN in a way to have capital losses from ARKK balance out with capital gain from AMZN but not fully, I want to keep an additional 3000$ that’s not covered by the AMZN gains to use it to reduce my taxable income. 

Is this the right math?

AMZN Capital Gain = 50k
ARKK Capital loss = 15k

Therefore I need to sell 15k of ARKK (all my ARKK stocks) and enough AMZN stocks that have gains totaling 12k. This way I save on paying taxes on 12k of AMZN and I reduce my taxable income by 3k. Is this correct?

Follow-up: how can I determine how many AMZN stocks I need to sell to get to a gain of 12k? (Let’s assume AMZN cost basis is 100$)

I think what I need to do here is to sell 12k/50k = 24% of my AMZN stocks. Is this correct?
I know I'm not supposed to *ever* use margin but..
I'm just starting with a tiny portfolio and got an ad from Robinhood offering me $1k margin "included" in my $5 mo Gold sub..

If I were to throw that $1k into an ETF or something boring, what would be the downside? At basically %0 apr.. and just buying stocks I would of been buying anyway.

I get that I need to pay that back and it's not free money, but it just looks like it would double my profits or loses with no added risk or downside.

Thank you for any input
What is the best strategy if I need cash and all my money is invested already?
Because of terrible job market, I will be in need of some cash near soon. I am non-US resident and most of my savings ($80K) are stuck in Schwab account. They don't allow margin loan for non-US resident. So that's not an option.

Most of my position are in gain, but I prefer not to liquidate them unless it's the best option. What should I do?
Sankyo Corp establishing a Monopoly in japan
I was researching companies with a moat and stabil integradet marketposition when I found Sankyo Corp. a japanese buisness fabricating and selling the japanese cult game Panchinko.

Sankyo has cash and cash equivalents of 1.9 Billion Dollars and almost no debt which results in 32,7$ Cash per share.

I calculated an approximately Asset Value of 2,098 Billion Dollar which results in 36,13$ per share.

The company has a high profitmargin of 30% which speaks for its strong marketposition.
I only know about one competing company which is Fujishoji Ltd a way smaller buisness in the same segment but with smaller profitmargin and decreasing revenue while the revenue of Sankyo is increasing strongly.

They both only earn money in Japan selling panchikos but it looks like sankyo establishing a Monopoly by gaining more and more marketshare.

Also the Cashflow is increasing very strongly. I calculated an average FCF-growth rate of 35,5% over the last 7 years and used a Discountrate of 15% which seems very conservative and calculated an intrinsic value of approximately 120$ per share. The current price is 45$ so we are applying a Margin of Safety of 65%.

In conclusion for me it seems like Sankyo is very strong buisness with an almost perfect balancesheet. It is increasing its revenue and free Cashflow constantly and has a high profitmargin and ROIC it is also paying a reliable dividend of 2.7%.
I know that in times of digitalisation the use of non-digital games will decrease but panchiko is a cult game which can be found in almost every japanese street. Because of the fact that this segment is decreasing I think that the probability of new entrants is very small which makes it easier to establish a Monopoly for Sankyo. 

Please let me know your thoughts about Sankyo. In my opinion it could be a perfect value company with a flourishing future in a shrinking industry.😉
option assignment process
I thought when market closed at 4pm if the stock closed out of the money the option is expired worthless 
but the option holder can choose to exercise until 430pm 

I sold a pit for amc 4.5 exp 8/11 and was assigned today on 8/12 
but amc closed at $5.26 and even at 430pm it is $5.12

So i am confused why it happened otherwise i would have closed it for $1
Need to withdraw, but which source, inherited IRA vs LTCG?
I'm in need of cash for a thing, and I have two places I could withdraw from.

Personal investments that would trigger long term capital gains, currently taxed at 15%

Inherited IRA taxed at income level, which I believe is 35%

I'm inclined to take the Inherited IRA.  There's over 100K in that account but being an inherited IRA I'm required to take a disbursement every year.  The minimum disbursement right now is 4-5k a year, I've always just sent it straight to the IRS.  Part of me wants to just empty this account and call it a day, and invest what I don't need to change it to long term capital gains.

Does that make any sense?  I feel like I'm bleeding out an account slowly that could actually be more useful if held as a long term investment.
Is Verizon (VZW) a buy right now?
With their stock at 2010 prices, paying 8% dividend yield, and pulling profits am I wrong that this is an amazing deal to put a chunk of money on?

They own a ton of tower infrastructure and are always on the cutting edge of technology from an outsider perspective. They also are breaking into lower priced markets with their other brand Visible. I feel like this is an amazing deal right now. Am I wrong?
Tax havens could cost countries $4.7 trillion, what this means for investors
Potential increase in regulatory scrutiny and reforms in countries enabling corporate tax abuse, potentially affecting the profitability of businesses operating here. Also the shift towards international tax cooperation under UN auspices could introduce changes in tax standards and cross-border investment dynamics.

Copper is the #1 Medium to Long Term Opportunity Out There, Here's Why
Both the supply and demand dynamics in the copper market are looking incredibly favorable.  
From a 2022 Goldman Sachs report, "Copper is so integral to the green transition – a global effort underpinned by government support – that the supply requirements necessitate a spike in copper prices"  
**Demand will increase**  
EVs, EV charging, electrical transmission, and renewables all use a lot of copper, and are set to grow for the foreseeable future.  
For example, an EV uses at least 2x more copper than a gas powered car.  
There also isn't a clear replacement for copper in these products, meaning the price can continue to rise without destroying demand.  
Aluminum is the most likely potential replacement, but not nearly as efficient (it would require a much higher volume of aluminum to do the same job).  
**Supply will not keep up**  
Supply is expected to fall well short of demand in the 2nd half of this decade.  
Ore grades are declining at many of the largest copper mines and there have been almost no major new discoveries in recent years.  
New copper mines can take 10 years to get up to full production, so they would not contribute to the supply equation until 2033.  
**TL;DR:** the world is going to need a lot of copper, there is no viable substitute, and the supply wont be there.  
**Disclosure:** I am long COPX, FCX, IVPAF and IE, though these do not constitute a large % of my portfolio yet.  
What are your thoughts? Am I missing anything? The most likely threat to the thesis above as far as I can see would be a breakthrough in extraction technology that dramatically increases supply.

Not sure why I am receiving so little shares after company did a SPAC merger
I'm trying to figure out why I have over 4,000 shares on Start Engine, but Jet Token finally went public through a SPAC merger and I am now receiving just over 100 book entry shares. I have been looking into all kinds of different readings on google, but I can't figure this out.

The company is now [Jet.AI](https://Jet.AI) after jet token merged with OXAC on the NYSE.
What's the endgame of refinancing or taking loans against assets to build wealth, as I see so many talking heads on the internet recommend?
Watching things like youtube shorts, I see a lot of 'money guys' talking about how they built wealth and avoided taxes by taking loans instead of selling assets, often pointing out that it's not a taxable event. 

So they take the loan, how do they pay it back? With income from their day job? They often brag about not having to work or being retired at the same time though. 

Also I hear regular down to earth landlord investors talking about refinancing and rolling equity into a new property, wouldn't they still have 2 mortgages at that point? They do it again and again...how do they pay these ever increasing loans?

If someone could just get me started on how this all works I'd be very thankful.
Opinions sought: where to rollover my 401(k)?
Just separated from an employer, and have a 401K at Fidelity that I'd like to do something with.

The obvious options:

1. Rollover to my existing IRA at TIAA-CREF
2. Rollover to my existing IRA at Schwab
3. Rollover to a new IRA at E\*Trade, (soon to be Morgan Stanley), where I have some accounts for my kids
4. Keep it at Fidelity

Something to consider: **I prefer a self-directed IRA where I can buy stock**, but this is not 100% necessary.

# So, what say you investing experts of Reddit?
Financial ETF that Excludes Banks
Are there any good Financial sector ETFs that exclude banks?

For example, I want to include companies like V, MA, SPGI, MCO, MMC, BRO, AJG, MSCI.  

Mainly I'm looking to fill the Financial hole in QQQ.  But I don't want banks!  lol

So that means not XLF or VFH.
How to retire in 9 years?
**Context:**

I'm a 28 year old USMC Vet, No wife no kids no real financial obligations. I have passive income from VA disability that I want to use to snowball retirement and retire between the ages of 37-40. So I would retire in 9 years minimum, possibly 12 years. I have abunch of service connected disabilities that control my life. Currently I am able to work while having these disabilities but they will get worse as time goes on and there will most likely be a point in life (Possibly in my 40s) where I can not physically work anymore. So I want to snowball my passive income right now into a retirement nest egg that I can hopefully live off of when the day comes that my disabilities are too much to continue working.

**Income:**

\-Mechanical Engineer Salary - 65k/yr

\-100% VA Disability + SMC = 48K/yr ($4,000 a month, this is tax free and doesn't count as income)

\-I do not need this VA disability to live currently, So the plan is to ignore it and have it auto invest while I solely live off my current engineering salary.

**Somethings to note:**

\-Currently I have no real financial obligations. I am single, No wife and no kids, no debt.

\-I do plan on being married with kids in the future, but want to take advantage of the lack of financial obligations right now to be as aggressive as possible with saving this money.

\-I will retain my military health insurance until I am 65. At 65 it will continue as long as I have 40 credits of contributing to social security / Medicare (Hence the 9 year minimum time frame, as I currently have 4 credits). This health insurance will be extended to my future wife and kids, so health care costs during retirement won't be necessary to factor in.

\-This VA disability income is for life, whether I die at 35yo or at 105yo.

\-The VA disability income grows 1.5-3.5% a year to match COLA.

\-Once I retire, I will stop investing the VA Disability and use it to live. (This gives me a baseline of 50k/yr tax free on top of whatever the nest egg will provide)

\-My ROTH IRA and Jobs ROTH 401k are in great shape, but I obviously won't touch those until my 60s. I will be doing all of this in a taxable account and trying to live off a taxable account until this

**The goal:**

Build a nest egg as aggressively as possible right now so that in X years when my disabilities are too much for me to continue working, I can comfortably live off of this nest egg + the 50k/yr in VA disability.

An example would be I put all monthly disability into SCHD ($4k/month, 48k/yr) and according to the dividend calculator im looking at that would yield me 20k/yr in dividends in 9 years. That would be 70k/yr in passive income (VA disability + 20k/yr in dividends, as I would switch from investing the VA disability to living off of it when I stop working).

**Currently:**

I'm using it to buy speculative stocks and blue chip tech stocks ie Microsoft, Meta, Amazon, Google, Rivian, Palantir, Paypal, etc. But this is alot riskier than ETF's.

**The question:**

\-If you were in this exact situation, how would you invest this money in order to best secure a comfortable future where you are not able to physically work / live life to the fullest?

\-Would you invest strictly into ETFS? Some individual stock picks some ETFs?

\-Would you do Dividend ETFs?

\-Should I max out my ROTH 401k to lower my current taxable income and live off of the tax free VA income right now instead of investing it? The problem I see with this is I wouldnt be able to touch it until 59.5 YO

\-What about high yield ETFs like JEPI or SPYI? Or would these be too risky with out alot of historical data behind them?

I realize none of us are certified financial planners, and I do plan on going to one. Just wanted to get a broad idea of a suitable investing path beforehand.
How much to add to inherited 529 Plan?
Slowly moving my inherited assets into a passive 3 fund. We also have an inherited 529 account worth 110k.  I'm trying understand how the inherited 529 fits into the equation. 

We have two kids 6 and 9. I've invested the 529 in an sp500 index fund option. 

Now that I'm reaching the end of investing the inherited assets into the 3fund and with new Roth rules pertaining to 529 - I'm wondering if it's worth it to add a one time amount. I believe the annual limit for us filing jointly married is 30k. I'm wondering if I should make a contribution of the last 30k left to invest to the 529 instead of into the 3fund in taxable brokerage.

Looking to invest some extra income I will be receiving monthly
I'm almost 60 years old, my husband and I grossed 90K last year. Next month I will be receiving about $500 a month from a settlement in which I will be responsible for paying income tax on. I'm leaning toward opening a Roth IRA. Heres what I/we have right now

In 401k's about 128K total 

Money market & savings accounts 38K and some 5year CD's 20K

Under loans 1 vehicle loan balance 8,500 and a home loan 73K 3.25% matures in 2038, but we have been making one extra payment a year so it will be payed off sooner.

No credit card balances.

My other idea was boosting my monthly 401k election for 500 to offset the income and put off paying taxes on it until later. Hope that makes sense
Self-directed IRA for investing or lending to (my) C-corp
I have an old e-trade rollover IRA and an existing 401k from my previous employer that I need to roll over. The total balance is \~$600k. I'm also the founder and majority shareholder of a seed-stage, VC backed startup. The startup could use the cash to extend runway as we approach a series A... and rather than further dilute my current shares with new investments, I'm interested in using some of my retirement to either:

1. Lend to my C-corp, or
2. Purchasing a Simple Agreement for Future Equity (SAFE) - though I'm not sure I still qualify as an accredited investor.

I understand there is an ROBS option; however, given our stage the c-corp share value is artificially low... thus the purpose of a SAFE investment vehicle.

EDIT:  sorry, this was a question... are one or both options I mentioned possible with a self-directed IRA?  If so, would I personally setup a self-directed IRA or would my c-corp setup the self-directed IRA so that I (as an employee) could rollover and invest?
Carbon Strategy Investment
Curious to see if anyone has invested in this emerging market. I have found a few ways to invest in this, as a lot of the individual companies are not public, there are few ETF’s available. What are your positions or strategies?

OXY- Occidental Petrleum subsidy

Dividend ETF versus high-performing ETF
I am retired and going through a divorce. My wife is entitled to approximately $1000 a month from my pension. However, she hast to give me about $100,000 from her 401(k). I'm looking to invest that hundred thousand dollars to make up as much of the $11,000 annually she's going to take from my pension. I'm torn between investing in a high yield dividend ETF such as JEPI or investing in a high performing ETF such as VTI. Any suggestions?
Hold my company stock or sell it?
Hi everyone,

I’m a 23M who works for a Fortune 500 company. 
One of the investments I make is contributing a portion of each check to buy the company stock. The company buys this stock and distributes it to me Bi-Annually at a 10% discount. 

I have now roughly $10,000 in this stock and I’m wondering if I should hold it or maybe sell out of some of the stock that I have owned for over a year and put it in a Roth instead? I feel like I’m getting too heavily invested in one thing and wondering if diversification would be good for the long term profit.

I currently have a 401k but don’t contribute to a Roth. 

Thanks for any advice!

Just opened a Roth. Question about "Smaller" ETF's
Just opened up a Roth. I'd like to get some Quantum Computing stuff into it for the long term, and have found QTUM by Defiance

I see that they only have $150m AUM though. I'm fairly novice on all this, but I guess I'm just worried that there is some risk of the ETF shutting down altogether at some point? 

Has only been around since 2019. I'm 29, so I dont plan on touching this for another 30 years. 

Any insight much appreciated - should I be worried that this ETF might not make it that long?

I also like AIQ, but their all time chart is insane & concerning

Thanks! 
Investing in emerging markets, which countries and sectors are you bullish on and why?
The whole macro paradigm is undergoing massive transformation which creates interesting opportunities to capture  growth and possibly asymmetric upside potential.  Also, as the dollar continues to struggle in international markets and the “Pax Americana” geopol model gets increasingly challenged by the BRICS economy and emerging nations, I felt compelled to deploy and test out  a broad ETF basket trading strategy.

What do you think of this approach to capture emerging markets: https://i.imgur.com/ckqkkzm.png  
  
Strategy overview: If there's a strong uptrend in emerging markets, I invest in a variety of emerging market ETFs. This strategy also has cases for when emerging markets are oversold or bearish.

Could inflation linked bonds outperform equities over 50 years?
Or would bonds (even treasuries) have defaulted at that point, because it would imply the economy has been so poor, or even a societal collapse?

If so, how much could bonds outperform?

In other words, how bad would things have to get (as measured by the equity market) for "risk-free" to not actually be risk-free?

I am not interested in answers like equities always beat bonds in the long run - this is specifically about engaging with the tail risks and when the black swans start kicking in. Any studies based on when different countries have defaulted would be interesting. Interesting qualitative answers are welcome too as will be hard to put numbers on anything!

Edit: for clarity, I effectively mean a single bond which matures in the 2070s, and the issuer must effectively pay for using their revenues at that time, rather than a rolling portfolio of bonds.
Brokerage with Lowest non-DTC OTC Foreign fee (F-share fees are outrageous)?
Fidelity is $50 in or out, TD is 46 in or out. Every place I check seems to have an outrageous fee to buy or sell F-Shares (non DTC). At this point I don't expect it to be free, but ~$50 each buy or sell is ridiculous.

Is there any reasonable place to buy and sell F-Share stock?

Where to allocate my money at age 19
Context: as of the last year or so I have been doing lots of research on how to let my money make money and currently the way that is working for me is I have around $2500 in investments, specifically Voo, and the rest (around $3500) in a high yield savings at 4.3% APY.

Question: would it be more valuable for me to transfer all but $1000 and dollar cost average into voo or should I continue to hold the majority of the money in a high yield savings? I don’t have anything I’m saving for or working towards. At the moment it is just sitting there.
Best way to deploy $750k-$1m in funds
I guess my situation is somewhat non-standard. 

I am 42M, married to a 44F with a 12 year old son. Both make good money. 

Unfortunately I have not done much market/stock investing up until 2019 or so. 

I currently have about $250k in 401k and IRA mostly in target date funds, $600-700k in RE equity (personal and STR investment which is generating a nice income with minimal involvement from me) and about $700-750k in cash with about $300k invested in a fairly liquid investment generating a 9% interest income and the rest in a HYSA earning 5.4%. That investment opportunity is about to end though in a few months so for the sake of discussion let’s say I have $750k in cash. By the end of the year it’ll be closer to a $1m in cash as I’m saving a large portion of our income and our expenses are pretty low. 

I’m looking to deploy the cash and the idea of dividends is very appealing to me. I thought about listing the question in the dividends subreddit but it seems pretty biased towards dividends (for a good reason), I thought about posting in the boggleheads subreddit but they have their own biases so I’m posting it here, in a general investment forum. 

With 13+ years from retirement (I really want to retire at or before 55) would I be crazy if I concentrated on dividend paying stocks as an investment strategy rather than pure growth ones? 

At this point I am pretty risk averse and don’t want to do anything crazy so please don’t suggest crypto and such :)
What about the upcoming ARM IPO?
There are many discussions on Reddit about IPOs in general. These are usually focusing on companies going public for the first time.

ARM is a very different story. This is about a company which used to be public, then went private and now (after a failed acquisition by NVDA) it's going to be public again.
Companies such as Apple, Samsung, Intel and Nvidia have been reported to buy into this company to get some control.

Let's talk about this opportunity.
What's people sentiment about this IPO?
What's considered a fair units price?
What's the market sentiment about this company?
What are the options to get into this IPO?
Is my fund portfolio good? decent? or total trash
I know a lot of people hate posts like this, but I have to ask, after a lot of back and forth, I've created a portfolio that I think isn't completely to trash

  
This uses the funds accessible in Sweden but the overall gist is this  
  
In my portfolio I have;  
  
70% Global - County Global Index  
  
10% Swedish market - Avanza Zero  
  
10% Growth - County Growth Market Index A  
  
10% Small/Medium companies:  
  
5% Handelsbanken Gl Small companies Ind Cri A1 SEK  
  
5% PLUS Small companies Sweden Index  
  
Is this reasonable as I have? I think my creation is perfectly fine. However, Maybe 70% globally is a bit juicy, maybe tone it down to 60% and put 10% in a niche fund such as Swedbank Robur Technology?
Buying Stocks = Putting yourself at the top of the pyramid
Guys - I am wrong in thinking that if you buy stocks and hold them, you are basically putting yourself at the top of the pyramid of capitalism? 

If you think about it, you own the company (to some extent) so even the CEO and the Board of Directors are working for you
confused on NTDOY dividend yield, was it really 10% last year?
NTDOY at 10% yield is huge. is that right? then somehow the forward dividend is only 3%? Can someone explain why it was so big last year and jumps to 3% next year? Is NTDOY a good dividend play since it seems to be such a well run company. However their stock have been much lower than it is right now in recent times.
Are credit lines drying up?
I've heard that credit lines for corporations are drying up. Can someone confirm that? Also, how does it look for consumer credits (I always see pre-approved consumer loans from my CC company and their offer got lower even though my credit score increased).
What's expected to happen during a recession?
I keep hearing the USA is reaching the limits of its debt and layoffs are gonna reach an all time high, but how does this reflect on the value of stocks?

My portfolio mainly consists of the biggest american companies, AAPL, META, MSFT and such, but I'm wondering how can I expect the values to move during a recession, how fast will everything happen, and if I should make movements about it? I'm very inexperienced in the topic.

* Will smaller companies losing significant amounts of money make the biggest ones grow due to occupying more of the relative market?
* Will they just go down in value at the same rate as everything else?
* Or will they be so big and stable that the most powerful ones will not experience the recession?
Ira account with chase no interest
My friend have an ira account with Chase for a few years getting almost 0 interest rate. I told them about my ira at vanguard get like 5%, but he doesn't want to switch. Is there anything similar to VMFXX that can buy from his account? Thanks for any help.
VTIP down 5% in the past 3 years?
Total newb question, but how is it someone can invest in "inflation protected" securities 3 years ago and be down 5% today? I'm seriously misunderstanding something. 
Current opinion on j&j spinoff Kenvue ? Worth it?
I received an email from fidelity notifying me of J&J’s spinoff with Kenvue. J&J is offering $107.53 for $100 of J&J. Is this worth it? Whats stopping me from buying 50-100 shares of J&J now and swapping 50-100 shares and then selling them for $753 profit? Swap is supposed to be tax free? Whats current thinking on this?
The reason why the stock market ALWAYS is over valued.
I know that to figure out whether the broad market is over valued is GDP to the diff indexs. Wilshire 5000, Sp500 etc.  When you do that, the market ALWAYS seems too high.  I'm guessing its because people today don't know what the hell to do w their EXTRA $$$.  They can buy a second house, they can buy bonds but really, other than the stock market, that's about it.

  Once Mutual funds came out IN THE 80'S  (which of course IS the stock market.) boomers and gen xers have been chucking their $$$ into that.  Teens today speculate on their phones with Robinhood with little fear of losing $$$  Nobody really seems afraid to invest in the market.

My grandpa (92) and his friends are/were TERRIFIED of the stock market. Nobody older than the baby boomers would put their $$$ anywhere near that thing. They were even a bit afraid of banks.   They would buy real estate or even freezers full of fish and drums of heating oil, cans of food but never stocks.  I'm guessing this is why the stock market valuations blew up more than anything else in the last 40 years. People now have less fear of the markets and they need SOMEWHERE to invest. 

What do you think???
ROA, ROE & ROI - How to use and across industries
All,

I guess 3 metrics don't really get a lot of attention, at least in discussions. I was wondering if people here take these seriously.

Mathematically, I know what these mean. However, I'm not entirely sure how to use them while evaluating a company.

Secondly, I guess you would give a higher preference to one over the other depending on which industry you are studying but I haven't come up with much answers either.

So yeah, if there are any experts here, i would love to hear from you on these 3 metrics and how to use them effectively.
European broker to trade US options
I have been looking for a trading platform that offers US options trading in Europe. I am considering a switch from my current platform IBKR, as I'm paying a lot in commissions. I know IBKR is one of the cheapest, so ideally a commission-free options platform. I have come across Aries and Trading Joe for commission-free options trading: it looks like TradingJoe is a new UK platform and serve Europeans. On their website, they reiterate that they don't use PFOF, as it's banned in the UK, but they use a Best execution model. It looks like they haven't launched yet; I signed up to the waitlist, but wanted to ask if anyone else has heard of them and what do they think?

Money Market Sweep Accounts
Recently learned that some brokerage accounts have a sweep feature that invests your unused cash into money market. 

I know Fidelity does that, but who else does? 

Don’t really want to deal with purchased money funds. The goal is to be as liquid as possible, and a money market  sweep feature sounds like it fits that need.
Thinking of moving money out of old job’s 401k
I have a 401k still living with my old employer. There is 18,900ish sitting over there. I was thinking about moving it to fidelity to be with my other accounts.  

Currently that full amount is in RHHTX but if I move it, I was thinking of splitting it up like this. 
10,000 FXAIX
5,000 FIOFX
3,900 FZROX  

Would that be a decent strategy?
How much will the probably war in Taiwan in 2024 affect the value of semi-conductor ETFs like SOXL? How much is the semi-conductor industry dependent on Taiwan?
I'm really worried about that war. This may affect the valuation of the ETFs I have in SOXL. I'm still down quite significantly, which is why I can't get out, but I'm worried that the entire ETF might be bankrupt because of the war. Is that a possibility?
Bond funds: Distribution yield vs. SEC yield
[VGSH](https://digital.fidelity.com/prgw/digital/research/quote/dashboard/summary?symbol=VGSH) (VANGUARD SHORT TERM TREASURY ETF) has a 30-day **SEC yield of 4.98%** as of July 1 2023. However the distribution on July 5 was $0.1586 per share, for a trailing month **distribution yield of 3.25%** (= $0.1586 / $57.48 \* 365 / 34, it had been 34 days since the previous distribution).

I know the goal of SEC yield is to help compare across bond funds given varying distribution schedules, but how can it be a useful metric when it is so disconnected from the actual returns?

I have learned that the SEC yield is more like the YTM, which assumes the bonds are held to maturity. How does that result in the lower distribution yields we're seeing?

Imagine a bond fund that holds only one bond at a time. While the bond is held, the distribution yield will only consist of coupon payments, but the SEC yield is factoring in the eventual return of principal, so the SEC yield will be higher (assuming the bond was purchased at a discount). But when the bond is traded, its advancement toward maturity should be factored into the sale price and then that appreciation should be part of the next distribution, therefore over time the average distribution yield and SEC yield should match. Is this right? So at some point in the future we should start to see distribution yields become higher than SEC yields, that way the averages will work out to be similar?

I am so confused and would really appreciate any help understanding this.
IRA CDs - Good idea for low risk investment?
Question is on behalf of my recently retired mother who rolled over $200k into a Trad IRA upon retirement.

* 63 years old and will be receiving a pension which will more than cover her living expenses
* Also receiving social security and has savings in case of any emergencies (should be comfortable financially)
* Won't be withdrawing anything from the IRA for the foreseeable future
* Has expressed interest in a low-risk investment (no longer has the risk tolerance for the stock market basically, though my suggestion would be to keep at least 20-25% in stocks)

My question is, given the high interest rate environment, is a good move here to drop those funds in a 5.0-5.5% APY IRA CD for the next 3 - 4 years? Why would bonds/bond funds (which I've heard recommended for investors with low risk tolerance) be better than CDs in this case? Isn't the guaranteed 5% a no-brainer?
Americans are pulling money out of their 401(k) plans at an alarming rate
Great news for the bears out there https://www.cnn.com/2023/08/08/economy/401k-hardship-withdrawals/index.html

> More Americans are tapping their 401(k) accounts because of financial distress, according to Bank of America data released Tuesday.

> The number of people who made a hardship withdrawal during the second quarter surged from the first three months of the year to 15,950, an increase of 36% from the second quarter of 2022, according to Bank of America’s analysis of clients’ employee benefits programs, which are comprised of more than 4 million plan participants.
What are some hidden gems not a lot of people are talking about?
What are some hidden gem investments currently in the underground stages today? I missed the gravy train with BTC back when it was first deployed because I didn’t play WoW (some people heard about it there back in the day) and had no idea knowledge of cypherpunk and cryptography. Any similar feeling opportunities that very few are looking into today? Or is there a website/forum where people discuss this type of thing where I can look further into the idea? Would be awesome to get into stuff like OpenAI but don’t think we are able to invest in it directly…
Does anyone use SeekingAlpha?
I've been using Seeking Alpha for years. I've found that the articles tend to be very narrow. There's article after article written about AAPL, GOOG, MSFT, NFLX, etc and basically nothing written about names like GLW, CBRL, or LH. I've also found that with some exceptions the articles tend to be low quality and wordy. You can spend 30 minutes reading an article that could have been written in a single paragraph. There are good authors and good information on the site, but the efficiency of the site can be low because of the high amount of noise.

What I find most useful is the portfolio news feed. This is small, succinct, bits of news that relate to my portfolio. Even in this feed there is some junk that wastes my time, but for the most part it's a good way to keep up with the things happening specifically with my portfolio of 30 or so stocks.

They have now added some sort of popup or paywall to where I cannot see the portfolio news feed or click on them. It's basically a join now button if you want to keep reading. The subscription costs $240 a year and I'm not going to pay that because of the reasons mentioned above. I already waste a ton of time on the site and it's just not a good value from my perspective. For that kind of money I believe I should expect much more professional work. 

So I have two main questions:

1. Is there any way to remove the paywall? I've tried numerous things with no success so far. 12ft.io, Githubs bypass paywall extension, different web browsers, mobile browsers, etc.
2. What is a good alternative for me to look at? Especially something that keeps me up to date with  news regarding my portfolio? Preferably free, but I'm not opposed to paying something if the price seems fair and the value is there.
Are there any free stock screeners that can sort companies by the date they were founded?
I'm doing research on unicorn companies and the path from foundation to ipo/acquistion and I need something that can filter/sort companies by the date they were founded as well as market cap.  
  
Bonus points if it can sort by ipo date as well, but that isn't necessary.
Is the money you're investing all "play money" or do you also consider it your savings?
I asked this on /r/personal_finance once and got answers I thought were a bit pearl-clutchy so I'd like to ask here.

I have over 9 months worth of expenses in HYSA right now. I have no debt and I'm not married / no kids. My idea was to keep 6 months worth of expenses in the HYSA as an emergency fund, and then invest the rest.

Right now I don't have plans to buy a house or anything like that anytime soon. But I would like to make the most of the money I have saved up. I was planning on investing it in things that are typically considered low-risk, like some of the typical mutual funds.

I totally understand that there is inherent risk in investing. But I wouldn't be relying on this money for anything, and would be able to wait through market downturns etc.

&#x200B;

EDIT: When I say "play money" I don't mean its a joke or not strategic or anything. I'm just saying that its money that is not your emergency savings and not bookmarked for anything like a house or car or tuition.
Is ETF a good investment strategy?
I’m able to save $3K-$5K/month. Is it good strategy to invest it couple of ETF like VGT/VOO etc. Not sure what’s my goal is but of course would like a high return. I would say Im looking for 5-10 years investment for now.

What do you guys think about it? What should I think off when i’m trying to decide what ETF is safe and good?

Is ETF better than buying stocks directly?
How do you evaluate your investments against inflation?
Is there a resource that indicates what inflation is YTD?

I would be interested in learning how others compare their investments' returns against inflation, specifically when looking at YTD returns.

I would also be interested in learning if anyone has been able to track inflation to their investments for the entire time they've held their investments (thinking of inflation as a benchmark, per se)

Because the Bureau of Labor Statistics data is always YoY, this doesn't add insight to how inflation is for the year. 

ETA: Another benefit of knowing the YTD inflation is that it could make it much easier to decide on which interest bearing investments to consider.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;
What ratio if any provides a good indicator of a stock/ etf general movement pattern?
Sorry if this has been asked before, but i've had a hard time finding the answer, probably because I am not phrasing my question accurately.   


Other than the general price performance of last X years, are there any other ratios that demonstrate if a stock or etf's value has a tendency to grow or decline or remain neutral?     


For example MLPX etf seems to be a bit neutral over last 5 years with some periods of sharp growth (mostly after covid a with most stocks) , and a lot of volatility.   


XHB seems to have a steeper growth rate despite a few big dips.   


AMZA had a sharp decline from 2015 to 2020  and now is a gentle but steady incline.

S&P in general tends to be bullish.   


I know the whole past performance doesnt indicate future performance... but if a stock/ etf seems to be able to handle turmoil in the market better, and continue growing, I'd like to find those options. And was hoping there was a good ratio or something to look at that would make sorting easier.

Steady income, where to start investing monthly/biweekly?
Hey everyone,

32 here working in healthcare. I make 4k-6.5k per month after taxes depending on how much overtime/double shifts I do.

Let’s say for my sanity I make 4k a month after taxes, what can I sensibly invest biweekly or monthly? Nothing crazy cuz I have to still put money into my regular savings and have spending money. But I’m interested in something that can grow slow and steady in the background without thinking about it?

I’m clueless. Thanks all!
Opinions on Upstart ($UPST) stock, recent moves, history, and future outlook???
     Hello all. I started trading back in 2020, and after a look of quick success (2020 was a good year, right?) I've come around to adopting more of an investing approach (finding a good buy-in and being willing to hold for years.) I kick myself in the ass sometimes when I see a 100% gain that comes back down to near break-even levels, and such was the case with UPST recently. Should I not worry about potential profits being lost and stay in for the long hall, or as much time as I've been watching the market and researching, should I know better than to let a 100% jump that occurs over a month go to waste? There's always going to be a pullback when something happens that fast, right? 
     Lastly, if anyone has any thoughts on the future of $UPST as it relates to its recent movements, US credit downgrade, and future outlook, I'm grateful for any of your thoughts. I hope everyone here might live their best life. Cheers!

I feel devastated and surprised by the likely accidental wrongful marketing of “put money aside monthly and Watch it grow into millions”
First, I know it will grow into million. Compounding interest and the raising water of index funds is undeniable truth. 

My shock and disappointment is in a nuance that was never mentioned amongst friends, most forums, and lots of finance books. 

So, my situation models after a typical decent American household and would be considered extra good for rest of the world. 

I’m 32 with a Household income after taxes of 60,000$

Set aside 20% every month into a IRA & Roth = 12,000/year

I plug that into a compounding calculator for 30 years with an average return of 9% (roughly a 50-100 year historical average) 

= boom 1,700,000$ 

I am rich!!!! Thank god I didn’t buy those Starbucks coffees everyday and invested it instead. 

But wait…. What’s guarantee in life: death, taxes, and inflation. 

1.7m in 30 years will not actually be 1.7m dollars today. 

Even worse, inflation compounds just as my interest on investments does. 

So an inflation calculator shows in 30 years “ This is an average inflation rate of -2.50% and cumulative inflation of -52.33%.” 

Meaning my 1.7m is actually 850,000$ when adjusted for inflation. 

Then 4% is a safe withdrawal rate of the 850k (inflation adjusted) = 34,000$ (and there will be a ~5% effective federal tax rate as married on the IRA withdrawal at least)

So my 20% saving rate(1k/m), with great 9% average returns, over 30 years with a tax deferred IRA/Roth account will result in ~2700$/m when adjusted for inflation. (Roughly half of my net income)

Now this isn’t bad, and paired with US social security, it is realistic 70-90% of my net income will be maintained in retirement. Great! 

But this is far from “oh my god, I’m rich and a millionaire in my pension years!!! Hello Florida and Thailand!”
What price do you get if you buy into a mutual fund on the ex-dividend date?
If you buy into a vanguard mutual fund before closing time, you get the close price at the end of that day.

But how is your price effected if you buy on the ex dividend date?

For example if the close price is $100 but the dividend is $2 would you pay $98 a share or would you pay the full $100, not receive the dividend, and effectively be penalized the $2 when the shares dropped after the dividend?
Ex Dividend Date trade question
A certain ETF has its ex dividend date tomorrow (Aug 10). If I do a trade today, Aug 9, with my brokeragte, would I get the upcoming dividend? Or would a trade (buy) today be too late for the dividend, given the two days timeline for settling a trade?  USA stock market.
Ibonds+EEbonds 20-25 year ladder
I think I've made up my mind but wanted to spitball with y'all too. I'm considering starting a 20-25 year savings bond ladder by buying 10k/year of Ibonds and 10k/year of EE bonds for the next 20 years. It would basically be for a fixed income portion of my retirement. I plan to fully retire no later than 25 years from now when I also have maximum social security benefits. The alternatives of using long term treasury bills and long term CDs is suboptimal I think because Ibonds are guaranteed to meet inflation (say 2.5% historically) and EE bonds if held 20 years the same (3.5% interest) and I expect low interest rates going forward due to government debt (they need inflation and low interest rates to keep low government debt). I should mention I have approx 1m in stocks/equity and 100k in cash savings right now. I prefer QQQ over VOO so this is part of building a bond allocation and also derisking from my QQQ over VOO preference. Thoughts appreciated!
Are Stock options worth anything if not used?
I apologize if this is a basic post. I recently was granted a bunch of Options. They are currently "vested" (vesting?) ... And my understanding is that I can "exercise" them.. which means they will be converted to actual stocks... But I'm curious if those Options have any actual value just sittting as they are (not exercised)? Some other posts suggest I should exercise them over time or a little bit per year (maybe tax reasons?).. but I'm not sure how that makes sense? If a company is currently growing it's best to get in while it's low right? I'm curious why a company would not just have the stocks already allocated for the employee
Is there a benefit to having your work 401k and your personal Roth IRA at different companies?
My work offers me a percent match into a  Roth 401k at fidelity. I just paid off my student loans, so now I want to open a Roth IRA and contribute the max over the next two months. Is there an advantage to ‘diversify’ your retirement accounts by hosting those accounts at multiple companies (e.g. open IRA at Schwab or Vanguard) or would I be silly to deal with more paperwork and just open the IRA at fidelity as well?

Edit: I just want to buy the market with an S&P500 matching mutual fund or ETF with low cost basis.
Efficiently Moving on from Robo Advisors
Hi all. Been lurking and searching for a while but had some difficulty finding the specific answer to these. If someone has a thread on point, please feel free to link and I will close this up. Thanks in advance. 

I have Acorns and Betterment accounts that I am looking consolidate to another brokerage. These are both taxable accounts. I want to pick my funds and not pay the fees they charge. I have two questions.  

1. What kind of account should I open and where? Are there places where there is a good sign up bonus? I want access to the Fidelity and Vanguard index funds. This is not necessarily meant to be a retirement account, I plan on leaving it completely for at least 4-7 years, but if my SO and I want to make a big purchase (new car, home reno or addition, etc) I am not going to be penalized for withdrawing (other than paying tax) from it.  Do I do an IRA or traditional brokerage or something else?

2. What is the best (meaning are there any tax differences) way to close these accounts and move everything over to the new account one? Given that they are both taxable, Is there a difference between withdrawing everything to my checking first, and then moving it over to the new account, or having the new account opened and trying to roll over like I have my 401k when changing jobs? Am I able to do that on a taxable account? 

Thanks again.
What are the most boring companies that have been great long-term investments?
The companies that we most often see discussed in this sub tend to be ones everyone knows about that make cool stuff, but what about boring companies? I guess Costco, Home Depot, Visa, and Mastercard fit this description. What are some other lesser-known ones?
Should I stay in blue chip/ETF combination for long-term investing?
In 2021, I received an inheritance. At the time, I invested around 20% of that inheritance into each of the following: Microsoft, Amazon, Google, Apple, and VTI.  
  
I since then have learned that diversifying and index/ETF funds are a safer way to go for long-term investing, which is definitely my goal. And I'm still around 20% in VTI.   
  
But with that in mind, I don't know if I should necessarily sell off any stock from the four tech companies right now. I could, and put that money into index/ETF, but they are all now turning some profit and mostly seem like safe companies at the moment.  
  
Again, I now know diversifying is key and index/ETF are safer moving forward, but at this point with where I currently am, what actions would you recommend?
SWPPX, SCHG, SCHD Brokerage
32yrs old and I’m rebalancing the mismatch of  investments I currently have in my brokerage acct and looking to set up a straightforward portfolio. Long term investment horizon. I’m looking for thoughts on splitting it between these three investments: SWPPX, SCHD, & SCHG. Any thoughts on this and the percentage weighting for each of the overall portfolio?
Is there anything similar to a Roth IRA but in Spain?
I'm Spanish 18M and, since most of the online content regarding finances makes reference to the American market, I came across several times the apparent amazing benefits of opening a Roth IRA and investing your money through it (all the tax free stuff and all of that) and I kept wondering if something like that existed within the Spanish banking system. Maybe with a different name or whatever, but keeping the same dynamic as the Roth IRA in the US. Does anyone know anything about it?

For opening a Roth IRA in the US, do you need to be a US citizen or is anyone able to open it, regardless of their nationality, residence, etc?
Is it really worth it to have an emergency fund as a student??
A while back, I started thinking about an emergency fund for my future. Next year I'm starting university and I thought of starting to put some money each month into a savings account just to slowly build the fund. Therefore, when I would graduate and go into de workplace, I would have maybe a couple thousand dollars in case something went wrong. But, upon thinking deeper into it, I ran into the the doubt I wanted to comment here. Since I'm obviously still living with my parents (18 y),  almost all expenses are covered by them (only additional purchases like buying a new book for myself, going out for dinner with friends and things like these aren't covered). So now I'm between the idea of starting to build the savings and build it for the future or continue investing all the money in my personal diversified portfolio. Which option would be more benefitial for me?
What is the name for this kind of annual interest and how to calculate?
My google-fu failed me. Everything I find doesn't seem to fit and I don't even know the name in order to find a calculator. Please be my best friend and tell me.

I want to know what is called when someone is like "I made a 2% gain every X days. It's basically a return of XX% a year, bro."
Question on margin buying
Hello,

I'm new to buying stocks. In my trading account on Ally, I see that I have some "margin buying power". Usually, I first move money from my checking account (different bank) to Ally trading account and then buy the stocks. It usually takes to 2-3 days for the transfer to complete.

I want to purchase some stocks today using margin ( can't wait for the transfer to complete). Tomorrow, if I fund the trading account from my checking account, will it be considered paying back the borrowed money? 

Thanks
Buying a property to let vs investing in stocks - which is best while leaving the country?
I’m in a predicament where I have enough money to get a mortgage to afford a property in the UK outside of London (currently living in London but can’t afford it). However, I’m looking at leaving the country for work for at least a couple of years in the next ~6 months.

I’ve read that there could be greater gains by putting money into property, due to capital gains and the use of leveraged money from the mortgage, even with paying interests. Versus the typical averaged gains from investing in standard ETFs.

Two questions:
- do you think it’s better to park your money in a property to let or stocks and share?
- if the answer is in property, is it worth it even with the hassle of getting a company to manage it for you while being abroad?

I understand that I’ll lose my first time buyers privileges here but I don’t think I’d like to live anywhere other than London if in the UK in the future. I also understand that there’s risks of dry periods not renting the property, and losses from damage/monthly fees if buying a flat, which does seem a bit stressful. Any thoughts are appreciated, thanks!
Fed's Bowman says more US rate hikes likely will be needed - Reuters
[https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/feds-bowman-says-more-us-rate-hikes-likely-will-be-needed-2023-08-05/](https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/feds-bowman-says-more-us-rate-hikes-likely-will-be-needed-2023-08-05/)

"The U.S. Federal Reserve will likely need to raise interest rates further to bring down inflation, Governor Michelle Bowman said on Saturday.

Bowman said she supported the Fed's quarter-point increase in interest rates last month, given still-high inflation, strong consumer spending, a rebound in the housing market and a labor market that is helping to feed higher prices.

"I also expect that additional rate increases will likely be needed to get inflation on a path down to the FOMC’s 2 percent target," she said in remarks prepared for delivery to the Kansas Bankers Association, referring to the Fed's rate-setting panel, the Federal Open Market Committee."

Data from last Friday also seems to underpin this:

Metric	Actual	(Estimate) :

* Unemployment rate: **3.5%**	 (3.6%)
* Average hourly earnings (MoM): **+0.4%**	(+0.3%)

So unemployment dropped back to 3.5% and wage growth added 0.4% which was above estimate. Keep in mind that Powell and the Fed pay alot of attention to those 2 specific metrics.

Also [Fed's own Nowcasting](https://www.clevelandfed.org/indicators-and-data/inflation-nowcasting) projects CPI +0.4% for the month of July (which is above the current estimate of 0.2%) and even **+0,6% for the month of August.**

Even with some margin of error those are both **way above 2% on annual basis** which would require on average inflation not be more than +0,17% so both July and August readings would be high above that.
JEPI vs VYM which is better to hold long term
I have around 3k to drop. Been looking to expand my portfolio with some good dividend stocks/ETF.

Right now I’m debating between JEPI and VYM.

I’m liking JEPI for the monthly income. 

Anyone have any opinion on which is the better buy? Lower fees? Exc…?
What is your investment process?
I’ve seen many people with many different investment process. I want to know how do you decide to invest in which sector, which country, which company? How do you decide when to buy or sell for which price? How do you decide which investment option you will take?
Power of attorney over PFIC - consequences?
My understanding is that you should not own PFIC (e.g. ETF domiciled in Europe) because it is a tax nightmare (paperwork and taxes due).  
However, what are the consequences of having power of attorney over a PFIC (e.g. account of foreign spouse)?  
Any problems here? Does this affect the US tax return and needs to be reported to the IRS?  
Thanks
Adding top companies on top of index funds?
I am receiving a good sum of money and I am looking to start positions in some index funds. I'm cost averaging down over the next 2 years but I am also considering adding additional position in the top 5 individual companies. Considering that the top 5 companies are responsible for a large portion of the S&P's growth I feel having slightly more exposure to these guys would be better and I also think that the bigger market cap's are going to be the ones that benefit from AI the most. I'm obviously interested in AI and trying to learn as much as I can but there is a massive amount of hype involved right now and I don't think a lot of these smaller AI companies will survive so I'm waiting them out before I start adding tech and pure AI plays. I started getting interested in markets 2 years ago and actually switch my college degree focus to finance. I have an opportunity to start building my own portfolio which is great so I'm wondering what everyone thinks of adding additional shares in the top 5 on top of the index funds? It's a pretty simple approach and I feel if the top 5 companies typically drive the S&P then I might as well get 100 percent exposure to them. I would look at doing 90 percent into index funds and 10 percent into the top 5 companies and will be holding for the next 10 to 20 years.   
Thoughts on investing in Russia?
since Putin declared war the Russian economy and stock market took a major hit and are at about 50% lower now than pre war and a lot of sanctions have been imposed on them , would it be good to put money now or after 1 or 2 years when the war is hopefully over and sanctions are called off
PayPal Stable Coin Discussion

Could the new PYPL stable coin be big for crypto price and PYPL stock? I don’t really know how it works, yet, they haven’t released much info on it. But would it allow you to spend BTC and any stores that accept PayPal? And if it does would that not create PayPal a lot of new customers and skyrocket the price of crypto? 

But also we have to see if the Government will actually allow PayPal to issue this stable coin because of the new statement they just released. 

What are your thoughts?

What allocation approach is implied by Toby Nangle's new FT article on narrow markets driving equity returns?
What I take from the article below is not to rely too much on a macro-driven asset allocation strategy.  But what asset allocation strategy makes sense in this environment then?

# Narrow markets should humble macro forecasters

5-6 minutes  
2023-08-08  
Toby Nangle   
The writer is a former global head of asset allocation at a fund manager  
This year has been marked by strong equity markets, and what looks to be an astonishingly narrow rally. Of the 16.9 per cent returned by the S&P 500 index in the first half of this year, 12.9 per cent derived from the performance of only 10 companies.  
With such a high proportion of a market’s value created by so few groups, it feels fair to question the tool kits of asset allocators and, more broadly, the product line-up of fund management firms.  
Narrow stock market returns are, after all, the norm. Research by Arizona State University professor Hendrik Bessembinder shows that more than half of the $55.1tn in net wealth generated by the US equity market between 1926 and 2022 came from the performance of fewer than 0.3 per cent of the market’s stocks, with the other half of this net wealth coming from the next best 3.1 per cent of stocks.  
Moreover, almost three-fifths of stocks actually destroyed wealth over the period. In quant-speak, the distribution of compound stock returns has been very positively skewed.  
In addition, the skewness of equity returns turns out not to be a particularly North American phenomenon. Indeed, in the three decades ending in December 2020 the proportion of net wealth contributed by the best 1 per cent of emerging market stocks was more than 80 per cent.  
Looking at the entire global stock universe outside the US, the proportion rises still further to more than 90 per cent. Winners have won big. Most individual stocks over the past 30 years have failed to outperform dollars stored under the mattress, let alone a local currency interest-bearing cash deposits — even after taking into account dividends.  
Bessembinder’s work has typically been surveyed in terms of what it means for active stockpickers — with some seeing it as a rationalisation for chasing moonshots and others for pursuing passive index-investing. Less examined has been what it means for asset allocators.  
Developed market stock index returns have been dominated by global companies — even if they each carry a domestic tilt. As such, connecting local macroeconomic developments to the performance of a region’s equity index can be something of a dark art.  
Single large stocks with an economic fate that has little to do with their listing jurisdiction have dominated national index returns. For example, the photolithography machine-maker ASML accounts for more than a fifth of the total net wealth created by Dutch stocks in the 30 years up to 2020. Global fast-fashion retailer Inditex accounts for more than a sixth of Spanish stock returns. Global luxury brands LVMH and L’Oréal collectively account for almost a quarter of the returns from French stocks. These are not outliers. One cannot explain long-term returns without reference to such companies in pretty much any region.  
If it becomes hard to explain equity index returns without reference to specific superstar groups, it stands to reason that it must be even harder to forecast equity index returns without taking a view on some individual companies. It’s easy today to focus on whether the Magnificent Seven that have powered the S&P 500 rally — Apple, Microsoft, Google owner Alphabet, Amazon, Nvidia, Tesla and Meta — might stumble. With more than a quarter of the US market’s valuation riding on them, the question is not at all trivial. But 30 years ago, five of these seven had not even listed. It’s hard to take a view on companies that don’t yet exist.  
I’ve been as guilty as the next asset allocator in explaining my preference for US over European stocks or vice versa with reference to some domestic macroeconomic outlook. Given that financials, utilities and property groups will carry a strong domestic flavour, this is still forgivable.  
But when constructing a long-term strategic asset allocation, it is becoming increasingly untenable to justify regional preferences with reference to local macroeconomic forecasts. This may explain why long-term return forecasts for equity markets — or Capital Market Assumptions, as they are known — have such a lousy record.  
The biggest single investment decision any institutional or individual investor is likely to make in their portfolio is their choice of strategic asset allocation. To create a strategic asset allocation one must make reasonable guesses about future market returns. Bessembinder’s research shows quite how invariably such reasonable guesses will be blindsided by the fate of single stocks.
Risk tolerance and diversification
I’ve been looking into different investment strategies and diversification. 
  I’ve been looking at a making a portfolio with 50-60% fzrox (or another low cost index fund) and using the remaining 50-40% to invest into individual stocks.   
For the remaining portion to invest in individual stocks I’m debating if it’s better to put smaller amounts into 10-15 stocks or higher dollar amounts into 3-5 stocks.   


How have you all balanced this risk vs. rate of return?   

I want to say my risk tolerance is fairly high and the time horizon for this money is a good 5-10 years at the earliest.
Concentrating bonds in a traditional IRA and stocks in a Roth IRA?
Between my traditional and Roth IRA's I'm holding 70% VTI, 22% VXUS, and 8% BND. Right now I have all three ETFs in both accounts, but I'm thinking it makes more sense to concentrate the bonds in my traditional IRA and the stocks in my Roth IRA. 

The stock ETFs should grow substantially by the time I retire (~30 years) and capturing that growth tax-free could save a fortune. The bonds won't grow as much so the taxes for withdrawing from a traditional IRA won't be as bad.

Does this strategy make sense? Are there any big drawbacks?
My 300K portfolio to retire early. Feasible?
Hi, I’m someone at 33 who can’t work well and unfortunately highly sensitive to any stress, so I’m willing to live in a low cost of living place to reduce the time to work. Lucky I have a passport in east Asia. The cost of living is like Japan. 

I think with a combination of stock, bond, and REITs, it’s not so difficult to get 10% yearly with max drawdown bellows 50%.

Portfolio will be something like these, (with symbols and yearly returns)

20% REITs: O 6% 

20% BDC: ARCC 10%

40% Stock: QQQ 15%, SPY 12%

20% Bond: I haven’t really looked into which bond to buy, but probably treasury with cooperation bonds around 5%-8%

It’s just a rough idea to show it seems possible and the ratio can be changed. Do you guys think it feasible? That means 30k yearly cost. 2.5 k monthly cost (including rent and everything). 

p.s Assuming one person only. I may accidentally get a family but I don’t want to make this estimation too complicated.

Any feedback is greatly appreciated, especially my portfolio. I know most people are overly confident in their ability to beat the market, so I thought better to ask here to ensure I don't overestimate myself and end up on the streets. Thanks 🙏
What have been your greatest dip-buying successes and failures?
Obviously, dip-buying is opportunistic and speculative, and does not fit into a sound long-term strategy. Nonetheless, it is human nature to succumb to the sunk cost fallacy and throw good money after bad. In some cases, it can turn out to be a well-played gamble. 

What are your greatest successes and failures from buying a dip?
How to best utilize wash sale rules if I take big losses but little gains in this year, but expect big realized gains in the next year, and so want to push those losses out to the next year too for tax offset reasons?
This is a question about managing active trading to best deal with large losses for tax benefit.  

Say I bought shares in 10 companies 2 years ago, say for $100,000, and these all tanked, and the positions sank to $30,000, but have since bounced and are now worth $60,000 (net $40,000 loss).   Say I expect their prices to imminently resume sinking again, so I want to sell now at the bounce to salvage as much as possible.  

At the same time, I don't want to realize the $40,000 loss this year because I expect to have no realized gains to claim this year to offset that loss against, and would essentially "lose" the loss for tax benefit purposes and be stuck only able to use $3k/yr of it against ordinary income going forward (is that right?).  And in the next year, say I plan to sell other long term profitable positions for $50,000 of realized gain, then I would be taxed on all $50k of it, with no losses that year to offset it.  

So, I would rather save the net $40,000 in losses now for the future year when I sell other positions that have large gains.  So if I sell those 10 positions now at the market bounce, can I indefinitely push off claiming this $40,000 as a realized loss by making sure to actively buy and then immediately sell the same positions at least every 4 weeks, for a couple bucks profit or loss?  This way I more or less lock in the current "bounce" prices of the losing positions, but not the taxable loss. 

Since I assume the basis on each position would remain high, due to the wash sales, then every time I would quickly buy and sell, whether a couple pennies up or down, would count as a disallowed loss (carrying over against that original high basis), and so continue to drag out the wash sale and high original basis, until sometime next year when I want to sell the winners, then I can finally sell the losers and simply not repurchase, and finally claim the $40k in losses to offset the realized gains. 

Is this a viable strategy to time the tax offset of selling winning and losing positions?  Is there an easier and less annoying way to do this same thing?

Guaranteed long term good investments?
What are some guaranteed long term good investments? Off the top of my head buying a used reliable car, solar panels if you live in a good area for them and index funds are guaranteed long term good investments. I am already doing the basics everyone should be doing but I would like to know if there are any other investments I am not doing.

Some non-financial investments such as exercising, eating healthy and building relationships are guaranteed to be good for you.
$TAN tough play or long wait
Hello everyone, I have dilemma and was hoping to at least get some closure here :)

One of my many positions is TAN ETF. In fact this is my first ever bought stock from February 2021 and if you check the graph you can see that I am down more the 48%.    


You can ask me why did't I sell, why I kept it all this time? 

Short answer is I don't know...fear, greed, hope or else. But the fact that I was able to build a decent portfolio for the past 2 years tells me I have to do something about this position.   
So my question is, do I sell and loose money, do I hold for God knows how long or a third option I haven't found yet?   
Maybe someone had a similar situation and can help me make a decision. 
When is the next recession?
I swear it's been coming since 2019 and every year economists 'revise' their forecasts and push it out another year.

I'm seeing some people struggling right now but others are completely fine.

Would like to start investing in the index but want to know whether to wait a couple months or just go for it. I know you can't time the market but those who invested in the 07 peak or pre covid peak are only breaking even now so it can definitely go wrong. 

Tldr: is a recession coming or not? Or are the middle class and below in a recession now and the wealthy have all the money anyway and are telling us everything is ok
Investing in companies facing (temporary?) backlashes
Just a note: This post is about investing and not any of the politics that may be related to any backlashes.

Has anyone had success, or have thoughts on, investing against (presumably temporary) cultural backlashes? Prominent recent examples might be Anheuser-Busch InBev (BUD) or Target (TGT). Both are down a decent amount (10-20%) over the past few months.


The thought being that they seem to be fundamentally strong businesses that are artificially low and that people don’t generally tend to permanently change their buying habits. If Target is the closest or best store to you, you’re probably not going to permanently drive to a store that’s farther away or worse. Something like beer might be more flexible, but even in the short term many of the people who switched beers moved from Bud Light to other InBev products.
Is OGEAX a good catch all fund to dump money into?
Hello all I was researching some initial investment funds to dump my extra cash into (like 300-500 a month) and was wondering if OGEAX would be a good fund for that. It seems to track the S&P well, are there others that I should look at for doing so? I want to stick to mutual funds but should I look at ETF’s instead for my situation?
FMC Outlook After Recent Drop
Over the past month FMC's stock has seen some fluctuations. The stock opened at $105.27 on July 1st and closed at $91.49 yesterday.  
  
FMC fell sharply after the company released its latest financial report. Despite the recent drop, FMC Corporation has a long standing history and a significant presence in the agricultural sciences sector. Their assets and revenues are substantial, indicating a strong financial position.  
  
**Target Price Estimate:**  
FMC's price should hover around $90 in the next week to month and look to make it's way towards $95.
Exercising Options Question
Hi all,

&#x200B;

I dabbled in buying an options contract for the first time early last year. It is a $12 call with a breakeven point of $13.40.

If i were to exercise the contract, would I be buying it at $12 or the $13.40 price? The underlying stock is currently trading at $15.07, so either way I would be making a profit if I were to exercise the option and sell the stocks. But I am trying to figure out how much I'd make.
Anything I should be doing to be more aggressive with my VOO/VT portfolio?
Hi all, 

Been a lurker on this sub for a while and really have gained so much insight from all of you on my investing journey, so shout out to you guys!

I am 27 and have a generally pretty boring portfolio with splits as follows:

1) VOO - 45%

2) VT - 40%

3) Individual stocks - 10% (lot of EV stocks since i have passion for them (especially rivian), as well as holdovers like GE, amazon, disney from investing prior to committing everything to ETFs)

4) DRIV - 5% (again, electric car nut, know its redundant, but nice to have a lot of the EV market outside of RIVN in an ETF, even if it is pretty top heavy with Google, etc.)

Know the overlap between VOO and VT, but when I started investing in ETFs, I was exclusively buying VOO. As I learned more, found out that I liked some exposure to international and small caps, but not enough to VT and chill lol. 

Recently, I have been having a strong desire to be more aggressive. I dont know if I am just falling into the trap of wanting to stray from "boring" investing, and end up shooting myself in the foot. 

Would love to hear from you all if I should just maintain a holding pattern, or if I am missing something important in my portfolio for somebody my age who is actually pretty risk tolerant? Appreciate you all!
Why is SCHD good to hold for growth?
Hi, I’m in the process of creating my portfolio. I read that SCHD is good to hold because its stable, has value stocks, and can buy cheap stocks in a downturn. I’m 18 years old so I would only invest in it (20%) for total returns - dividends, dividends buying up cheap stocks - rather than for passive income. 

I also want to invest in XLK + VTI. Say, 30% XLK 50% VTI 20% SCHD. 

For those invested in XLK, what do you think about the idea of Efficient Market Hypothesis? And that expectations and predictions are already factored into the stock’s price so to really get the performance we are expecting XLK really has to outperform. Is this true? Why are you still invested?

And if you know anything about OMFL, do you think its a better bet than VTI long term? It performs better than total market / s&p500. Do you think it is safe to bet on large cap over small value? Though that is what many are already doing with VOO etc.  

Oh and - if you know enough to answer this - how true is it that dividends aren’t necessarily “free money”? That is true right? Companies are taking money out of their stock price and putting it into our hands. So you lose out on capital appreciation and instead its in your hands. Is this stance true or not the full picture?

Thanks!
Investing in a gig company
There is a website that is subscription based where you can post tasks to get done and people to do the job. Something similar to Task Rabbit called RunnerCity. I have successfully used it several times and it had always been a good experience. Because I signed up back then when they first started they are allowing early founding member to invest in the platform and this was part of the founder application. For some context they raised $250k in 2021 and generated $1m+ in transactions. They are now wanting to expand to 30 more cities across the state. 

Here is the offering:

If the raise hits $125,000 or less the pool will own 2% of the company. 

If the raise hits $250,000 the pool will own % 4 of the company. 

If the raise hits $500,000 the pool will own 6% of the company. 

If the raise hits $750,000 the pool will own 8% of the company. 

If the raise hits $1,000,000 or more the pool will own 10% of the company. 

I’ve got some disposable income to invest $1k. What do you all thing? Thanks.
Risk analysis and interest rate sensitivity for fixed income funds
I’m trying to create a model to compare risk of fixed income funds. I’m finding most do not post duration. I was wondering if anyone had any better ideas for risk analysis on these type of assets. I don’t have the time to pull 1000’s of debt assets and calculate duration. I’m considering correlation of % change in price and net change in yield to net change in treasury yields.
Contribute to an ESPP with AMN Healthcare?
AMN has lost 18% share price over the last month, 5% over the last 6 months. They have also lost roughly 30% in revenue Q2 and is expected to lose another 20%+ for Q3. Today, they announced an ESPP program which allows purchase of shares at a discounted 15%. This is purchased in a lump sum amount after 6 months of payroll deductions. I have never contributed to an ESPP before (has never been an option until now) and am weary based on past performance that this will prove unsuccessful or even lose money over the period. Thoughts?
Question about taxes when withdrawing from an account.
I have a few different portfolios on the Stash app and I just want to make sure I have something right. I have an ‘smart’ portfolio with stash where their “experts” invest my money into different markets and they say that it will grow. But it has been nearly 3 years now and it is down by 7.10%. I want to just withdraw this money back into my bank account so I can personally invest into what I want instead. My question is: will that money be taxed since it has made no net dividends?
QQQ as a long term investment
How does this subreddit feel about QQQ as a primary investment? 

 I have talked to a professional investment group about managing my cash and they advised me that they would charge 1% per year and could not beat the NASDAQ in the long run. I decided to not invest with them.

I am 35 and earn 75k a year from my job and live in an affordable part of the country. Currently I have around 175k of my own cash in QQQ and another 85k in my work 401k. I was wondering if there is a better investment that I should be looking at?

My goals are to grow my wealth over the next 20 years while minimizing unnecessary risk.
Long term capital gains question
If I own stock(s) or leap option(s) for more than a year, and then add to my position by buying more of that same stock or option without selling any, how does that affect my holding period? 

Do I need to wait another full year before I can realize any long term capital gains? Is there ensure that if I sell, I'm selling the assets I've held for a full year and not the ones I've purchased recently?
IWY or SPY. Which ETF is better?
I just had my analysis about IWY posted, and here is the link. [https://seekingalpha.com/article/4624890-etf-comparison-iwy-spy](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4624890-etf-comparison-iwy-spy)

Essentially, IWY is pegged to an index (Russell Top 200 Growth) that does not significantly outperform the S&P 500.  Throw in the operating expenses, and it is not an essential ETF to one's portfolio.  Look for better opportunities elsewhere. I am always glad to share my data.
Master thesis on cognitive biases among investors and their impact on stock market efficiency
Hello r/Investing!  
In this upcoming fall semester, I am writing my Master Thesis on a topic within Behavioral Finance. More specifically, I want to write about cognitive biases among investors and how such biases can affect stock market efficiency. I know this topic is not very concrete and my research question will need to be a lot more precise.  
I have been looking at certain journals of behavioral finance, etc, but a lot of the studies have access to advanced data which I wont have access to.  
Do any of you have a good idea for a topic or know of any interesting, publicly available data, which can be used for my thesis?  
Any input is highly appreciated!

Thinking of selling all VOO and putting into VTI. Tax issues?
I currently have more shares of VOO and VTI and after reading various posts, most would agree that VTI apparently is a better stock to chose in the long term.

My question would be, if I were to sell all of my shares of VOO and put all that into VTI, will i have to pay taxes for the profits gained from the VOO that I've held for \~3 - 4 years?

&#x200B;

EDIT: Thanks for the responses everyone. Will go ahead and just leave VOO alone and start putting more into VTI moving forward.

$PMET Patriot Battery Metals
What are your thoughts on PMET? Looks promising for long term when you look at the test results from the cv5 drilling sight. Also the strategical investment of C$109 million for 7% from Albemarle Corp and the fact that its the only lithium discovery in north America sounds good to me. What are your thoughts for long term?

YTD is 295%.
Target date 401k or should I reallocate?
32 years old have about 70k in IRA traditional and about 6k in IRA Roth. They are both set to target date funds. I am looking to move them into something else if it makes sense ( seeing mixed bag of literature  on whether or not to keep target date) wanted some advice from others who have gone through the motions already. My personal brokerage and dividend portfolio is about 170k. I love dividends and watching the snowball, I just feel like I'm losing out on possible tax free gains in my Roth and late retirement tax benefits in my traditional if I don't set them up to be aggressive while I'm young. Thank you for everyone's input who takes the time to respond.
If you had 60k to invest in either Apple or Google, which would you choose?
As the title states, I have 60k I’d like to invest in a strong tech company as part of my retirement portfolio. Both companies are very attractive. Obviously Apple pays a dividend so I could drip over the next 19 years. But google has their hands in so many potential markets (AI, autonomous vehicles, medical…) that the potential for growth is very attractive. I’m forty-six and plan to retire at 65 (to gain full pension and medical). I’m not a savvy investor and want to do the right thing to provide added security for me and my wife. Are there better options that I should consider? We have a vanguard Roth, 401k, that we only established a few years ago. We max out our investment every year. Thanks for the advice and please let me know if I’m looking at this completely wrong. Again, I am not a savvy investor!
Worried about taxes/setup of my current investing model
25 years old - I have my paycheck going to 3 places. I gave the accounts labels if it helps as well. Besides 401k the others are not final and my question on all of it is at the bottom.

9% + 3% match to 401k Investing in American Funds Target Date 2060 Fund which is described as a balanced asset mixture.

•	⁠Retirement.


6% to Vanguard where depending on available balance to spend goes to VOO or VTI

•	⁠Large purchase down the line like a property.


4.3% goes to TD where I had the bulk of my original funds before starting my 401k. This is mostly compromised of ETFs however it has a handful of stocks in certain sectors I see as promising. Will trade long dates option spreads every once in a while on this account as well.

•	⁠Getting the ball rolling on my potential future kids college tuition. Could also be rainy day, I’m just saving.


Is there anything worrying about the Vanguard/TD setup? If I hold for a few decades is there certain tax info that I should be aware of or worried about? I don’t want to get closer to the end of my career end up having way less than I actually thought. Should I rebalance where I allocate my funds?
Selling owned stock to buy options in the same stock?
This pertains to an ESPP. I own stock in the company through a payroll deduction (after tax) that I stopped a while back. I also have some options that are available to exercise that are significantly cheaper than what I bought the ones I own for. I do want to continue to own it as it has seen good returns but I don’t really want to get any heavier in it. It seems like a good option would be to sell the ones that I own that qualify for long term capital gains and buy the cheap options.

I understand I will be paying the taxes on the difference for the options but are there any downsides I’m missing anything? Are there any penalties for this move I don’t know about? I do have a plan on how much of this company I want to own in the interest of diversification so no worries there.

Thanks.
Diversify or hold onto successful stocks?
Years ago I invested a few grand into GOOG and TSLA in my Roth IRA. Ever since then I’ve only purchased diversified index funds with my contributions. Today, however, these two companies represent half of my retirement portfolio due to their growth. Should I hold these stocks because they are performing well or reduce them to a specific percent in my portfolio?

For context, I am a 29 year old government employee contributing toward a pension plan I can collect at age 65. I have a 457(b) and a Roth IRA- hoping to retire at age 55.
What happens to investments when you leave Edward Jones Financial Advisor?
If I were to leave Edward jones altogether and move it into vanguard, what happens to my investments? 

-do all investments get sold? This would mean I would be given cash to then invest in vanguard and I would have to face tax implications on capital gains

-does it transfer cleanly? 

-does it transfer as much as possible (ie: NVIDIA stock could transfer but a fund specific to EJ wouldn’t) 

-other?

Best brokers for investing in third world countries markets in the US
I'm from the US and have recently taken interest in investing in foreign nations index funds with high growth potentials, especially Nigeria and India. Unfortunately my main broker (Fidelity) mostly just offers markets in Europe and North America. Is there an accessible broker in the US which has access to more markets in developing nations? (Especially Nigeria and India)
I asked ChatGPT to give me prompts to find interesting stocks
Instead of trying to come up with prompts to find stocks myself (only losers come up with ideas on their own).

  
I just asked ChatGPT to give me prompts to find stocks with potential.

  
I asked it to give me a quick explanation behind each prompt too.

  
The results were pretty interesting.

  
Note: You’ll need ChatGPT Plus and have the Boolio Invest plugin enabled for these to work.

  
It took a lot of trial and error for it to come up with good prompts. Some of the prompts it came up with were cool e.g. "Find companies with a market capitalization under $5 billion that have expanded into new geographical markets in the last 2 years." but there was no way for ChatGPT to actually find the answer.

  
Here are the best prompts it came up with (that worked for me)

**Prompt 1**  
Prompt: "Find stocks with a P/S ratio below the industry average, positive net income, and a dividend yield of over 2%."  
How it works: This prompt focuses on commonly available financial metrics like P/S ratio, net income, and dividend yield, allowing for a comprehensive analysis of potential value stocks.

**Prompt 2**

Prompt: "Search for stocks with a Price-to-Earnings (P/E) ratio below the sector median, a positive net income for the past 3 years, and a dividend yield above 3%."  
How it works: A P/E ratio below the sector median can indicate undervaluation. Consistent net income shows profitability, and a decent dividend yield provides income, making it a comprehensive approach to find potential value stocks.

**Prompt 3**  
Prompt: "Search for technology stocks with a 3-year revenue growth rate above 10%."  
How it works: This prompt targets the technology sector and focuses on revenue growth, a key indicator of potential high growth.

**Prompt 4**  
Prompt: "Find companies with a market capitalization under $2 billion that have increased their market share in the last year."  
How it works: This prompt looks for companies that are still small but are growing.

**Prompt 5**  
Prompt: "List healthcare stocks with an R&D expense growth of over 5% in the last year."  
How it works: Focusing on R&D expense growth in the healthcare sector can uncover innovative companies.

**Prompt 6**  
Prompt: "Identify stocks with a consistent track record of meeting or beating earnings estimates over the last 4 quarters and a P/B ratio below the industry average."  
How it works: Earnings estimates and P/B ratio are widely used in financial analysis. This prompt combines these factors to find stocks that may be undervalued and have strong operational performance.

**Prompt 7**  
Prompt: "List stocks that are trading at least 20% below their 52-week high and have a Return on Equity (ROE) above the industry average."  
How it works: Stocks trading significantly below their 52-week high may be temporarily undervalued. A higher-than-average ROE indicates that the company is generating good returns on shareholders' equity, suggesting strong management.
Need a brokerage account for buying stocks?
I have a ROTH IRA account and an HSA account on Fidelity. I really believe in a couple start up companies and want to invest in them. I understand this is a gamble, but I am hoping years from now they investment will pay off. My question is, do i need to open a separate brokerage account to do this? Or can I add some cash to my roth ira and buy specific stocks through that? Is there an advantage to doing one over the other?
Money market or short term treasury fund?
Hi all. We all know that keeping savings in a traditional bank account is a ripoff right now (<0.10%) so I've been keeping it in VUSXX (Vanguard Treasury Money Market) and VMFXX (Vanguard Federal Money Market). They both give around 5%, but I'm also aware it could change at any time. 

So I'm looking into VSBSX (Short Term Treasury Index Fund). The rate is a bit lower (and will increase as more recent higher yield bonds are added) but I think it will stay that way for longer. I'm just not sure of the mechanics of money market funds to know how long it will take for the rate to change.
23.97% return investment strategy fund
In his "What Works on Wall Street" book, James O'Shaughnessy creates and describes the investment strategy called "Improved Cornerstone Growth" (page 302, third addition). He back tests this strategy to 1963 and shows the average return of 23.97%, which is almost double of S&P500. Question: why isn't there a mutual fund that implements this strategy? (I searched far and wide and came up with nothing). Wouldn't this be a best seller of a fund?

As an individual retail investor I simply have no sufficient funds to implement this strategy on my own.
Implications equal weighting an MSCI High Dividend Yield index
Using my broker's Pie feature I'm looking into manually replicating the [MSCI Japan High Dividend Yield](https://www.msci.com/documents/10199/a2dc8d4b-d506-4d5d-8fc6-78eb37096df6) index. The index consists of 38 stocks only so it won't be a lot of work.


I ran a Fama-French 6 factor regression on the index and the results are pretty good:

```
                 coef    std err          t      P>|t|      [0.025      0.975]
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Intercept      0.0505      0.095      0.534      0.594      -0.136       0.237
MKT            0.8560      0.030     28.585      0.000       0.797       0.915
SMB           -0.0278      0.042     -0.660      0.510      -0.111       0.055
HML            0.3351      0.079      4.262      0.000       0.180       0.490
RMW            0.2204      0.109      2.030      0.043       0.007       0.434
CMA            0.2250      0.105      2.153      0.032       0.019       0.431
WML           -0.1542      0.046     -3.367      0.001      -0.244      -0.064
```

High exposure to HML, RMW and CMA. Negative momentum but I think that's expected from an index that is value-tilted.

**The index is market cap weighted and I'm wondering what would be the implications on factor exposure if I equal weight it.**

Equal weighting would give more weight the smaller stocks so SMB should increase.

However what about the other factors? I compared **MSCI World** with **MSCI World Equal Weighted** and SMB and HML increased, while WML dropped.

Should I expect similar results here? I'm wondering because even though the index is market cap weighted, several screens have already been applied to it (the high dividend screens).
High interest savings account HISA
What do most people do here with your 6 month emergency fund? 

Keep it tied to a high interest savings account that is actually the traditional savings account (around 1 or 2% approximately) and directly linked with your chequing account etc

Set up a non registered account and purchase something like CASH.TO or an cash investment that has interest around the 5% mark. 

I'm curious if the emergency fund should be immediately accessible with a click of a button. A non registered cash savings amount can take several days actually selling then transfering between accounts.
Why is the solar industry performing so poorly?
Year to date, the Invesco Solar ETF (TAN) has returned -13.1%. Over the same period, the S&P 500 has returned +17.1% (and global equities, to be less US-centric, have returned +13.5%, using VT as a proxy). Why has the solar industry performed so abysmally? 

There was clearly a clean energy bubble coinciding with a growth stock bubble peaking around 2021, followed by a substantial correction for both. I know rising rates haven't helped either, since a lot of solar companies have future cash flows now heavily discounted. But while growth stocks in general have recovered marginally from their lows (VUG is +33.8% YTD), solar stocks are hovering around 3 year lows. Why is the solar industry's performance exceptionally bad?
Is there any point in selling if holding on to your profitable stocks?
I began investing in November 2021 and in hindsight I probably spread myself a little thin and bought into too many companies. Hopefully the screenshot I've provided is clear enough but just to add some context, the companies I've invested in more than once are:  
 
&nbsp;



Agronomics, Merck KGaA, Emmerson, Berkshire, Brookfield, Microsoft, ASTS and Rocket Lab. Most of the others I'm happy to just let run at this stage.  
&nbsp;


I'm in my early 30s so I was looking to take some risks (clearly). There's no incentive to invest in an ETF where I'm based (otherwise I wouldn't be stock picking). In hindsight I made some really poor decisions when I started out and it's sort of made me put my money on deposit since late 2022. I'm not sure what's the best move here.
 
&nbsp;

My current position is:  
&nbsp;

66k on deposit. I'm holding it for a potential house deposit down the line.&nbsp;

41k invested since the end of 2021 but this is now only worth 29k.  


&nbsp;

 

The stocks I'm no longer convinced by: 

&nbsp;


ASTS 

Polight 

Rocket Lab 

SOFI 

Steakholder Foods (formerly MITC)
 
&nbsp;


Does it even make sense to get rid of some of these if I'm planning to hold onto Berkshire, Alphabet etc for the foreseeable future? Is it basically just a case of letting the losers run and then offsetting them against any gains down the line?

Thanks in advance.
If this is a bad economy, please tell me what a good economy would look like
We should acknowledge that things are going well, even as we continue to look for problems to solve.

By Noah Smith

I do not want to be a shill for the Biden administration. Yes, I like most of what Biden is doing on industrial policy. But I really want to resist being one of those center-left pundits who always just blasts out the latest press release of a Democratic administration and trumpets how many jobs the President has “created”. That sort of partisan cheerleading would be damaging to my credibility (or at least my self-respect) as an independent analyst of the economy, and it would also play into the kind of silly simplifications that the media too often uses to talk about the macroeconomy — for example, the idea that the President “creates jobs”, or is responsible for everything that happens to the economy under his watch.

And yet when I look at how the U.S. economy is doing right now, I find it difficult to describe it in terms that allow me to avoid sounding like a shill. I know lots of Americans still think the economy is doing poorly, and are upset about that. But when I look at objective measures, I just can’t rationalize that negative viewpoint. Because as far as I can tell from the actual numbers, this economy is doing really, really well.

Why the economy is doing really, really well

What do we want from the macroeconomy?

We want employment to be high, meaning that as many people as possible who want jobs can get them.

We want inflation to be low, so that people have certainty about how far their paycheck and their savings will go in the future.

We want real incomes to rise, meaning that we’re able to consume more than we could in the past, or save more if we want to.

(There’s a fourth thing we might want, which is wealth, but that’s more complicated and I’ll talk about it later.)

Basically, this is the whole list. If people have jobs, inflation is low, and real incomes are rising, the economy is good. That doesn’t mean people necessarily realize it’s good — social strife, or partisan polarization, or lingering pessimism from past disasters may cause people to be pessimistic about the economy even in the face of great data, a phenomenon some refer to as a “vibecession”. But while I acknowledge that people’s feelings are important and that there are other things that matter besides the economy, when I’m analyzing how well the macroeconomy is actually performing, I can’t go on vibes.

And when we look at the objective numbers, they are great. First of all, there’s the employment situation. Some indicators of employment, like labor-force participation, look bad because we’re in the middle of the great Baby Boom retirement. That’s why you generally shouldn’t use measures of the labor force that don’t adjust for age! When we do adjust for age, we find that the U.S. job market is now the best that it’s been in recorded history. Here’s the employment rate — i.e. the percentage of Americans who have a job — adjusted for age:

https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fab8bdbf8-7696-4c14-b516-f1babc5b19b8_791x533.jpeg

This shows what the employment rate would have been since 1981 if the fractions of the U.S. population in each age group were the same as in February 2020, right before the pandemic. Basically, we have a much older population today than we used to, and this is a way to try to take that into account. Now you can say “Well, if the labor market of 2023 were as good as 1999, then old people would be working a lot more in 2023 than they did back in 1999.” And maybe that’s true, but if so, there’s not really much way to tell. The assumption that aging works about the same in 2023 as it worked in 1999 seems like a good one. And even if the reality is a little bit off from that assumption, we’re still pretty damn near the best labor market ever.

Next up we have inflation. This has, of course, been the big problem since the start of 2021. But now inflation is plunging; if it’s not back to its target, it’s headed there very rapidly. In month-to-month terms, PCE inflation (which the Fed likes better than the more commonly used CPI) is now below the 2% target.

https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb08b3c8c-ac2a-417b-958b-3254f4efec64_1318x450.png

Slower-moving measures are all headed downward. Broader measures are falling rapidly as well. And when you include the rents that people are paying on new leases instead of rents for leases signed long ago, inflation looks even lower. Meanwhile, market inflation expectations, measured by the 5-year breakeven, increasingly look like they’ve been completely tamed, which means people think the Fed has inflation under control in the long term:

Choosing a bank for the future
I invest.  We all do.  But I keep my money in a old school traditional bank that offers almost no interest, and is in the news a lot for shady behavior.  And I'm thinking to myself, there has to be a better solution for my day to day funds.

So I'm asking this community, where would you recommend keeping your day to day funds?  Am I living in the stone age with an old timey checking account?
Is Yahoo Finance Data Wrong?
Hey I’ll keep this short just cause all I want to know is if somebody else has seen this. I find yahoo finance data to be wrong sometimes. For example, I was looking at FTNT and it’s cash flow statement and I found the TTM value to be completely different than if you added each quarters cash flow together. I feel like I have seen the same thing before and was wondering if you guys have since it’s a pretty major problem if it’s true. Let me know
Is the Stock-to-Flow Model Applicable to Bitcoin?
Hello everyone,  
The Stock-to-Flow model is often mentioned in discussions about Bitcoin's price predictions. Given Bitcoin's unique characteristics and the constantly evolving cryptocurrency market dynamics, is the Stock-to-Flow model genuinely relevant for Bitcoin? I'm interested in hearing your thoughts and would appreciate any empirical evidence or studies that might support or challenge its application.  
Thanks for sharing your insights!
Do people who contributes a lot on their traditional IRA always pay the 6% penalty?
I’m talking about people who contributes $10k+ a year because they make a lot more and wants to put all their money on their traditional IRA. Or is there another strategy to invest on the same IRA without penalties? 

I just can’t find any info of why there is a 6%penalty for contributing more than $6k a year.

Like, do rich people just pay it yearly and move on?

Edit: This is regarding when filling taxes and IRS stuff.
Looking for a unique solution
Im in search of a business that will allow me to make small online credit card transactions (like $1.00 or $2.00) on an automatic scheduled basis. Preferably on a platform that would allow that money to be used for something like investments/stock or food. If those options aren’t available to me perhaps there would be a way to put the money towards online gambling, video game micro transactions or mobile gaming, but the investment option is preferred. Something that I could purchase once a month once the account has accrued between $5.00 or $10.00. Strong emphasis on “online”, “automatic”, and “credit card”because I don’t want to waste time making these small transactions in person or online and need the credit card transactions to qualify my credit card rewards system.

Currently I use Amazon and I manually load my Amazon wallet with ¢.50 using 5 separate credit card transactions all in the same day($2.50 a month). Not extremely time consuming either(takes about 5 minutes to do). But I am forced to spend it on Amazon.

Would be really cool if we can find an investment option even if it did cost a little more, just so the money can be more liquid if I wanted to use it. Very appreciative of any help I can get!

Timing of the economic slowdown/recession
Usually experts says that it takes 12-18 months for the interest rate to hit the economy. Today 10 months have passed after the couple of large rate hikes (November 2022).

  
If there will be a economic slowdown or recession, what do you think will be the timing of it?

  
If I am not wrong, at the moment the economic consensus is that the worst is passed and the second half of 2023 and 2024 will be better? 

  
On the other side, if you think the worst will come at the end of 2023 or beginning 2024, isn't it gonna be the worst possible timing for the spring/summer 2024 US elections campaign?

First time investor using Alinea - legit or not?
I've been wanting to start investing in stocks, but as a first gen college student I really had no idea where to start and who to trust. I get a lot of ads for Alinea but I'm not sure if its legitimate or a scam, or even how to tell if it is one. Does anyone have experience using it or know about it?
Should I rebalance 401k portfolio?
My portfolio is sitting at almost 50k in my 401k and I'm 32. This is how I had it split, I think I just randomly choose funds that sounded good. I do have another stock portfolio and Roth with mostly sp500 and total market index funds with Schwab, and 40k in a high yield savings. I think I should redistribute everything to a total index fund or sp500 in my 401k, but is that too conservative?

Schwab ($SCHW) - Still Undervalued - Thoughts?
I still think this stock is largely undervalued - it's coming off of a huge drawdown from the market panic in March and hasn't fully recovered. If you look past the noise/media hysteria, the bank is well capitalized and cash sorting (i.e., folks moving deposits into treasuries) has largely subsided. 

They have an excellent management team along with a strong dividend. They're trading at 15.5x forward earnings - if you look at it on a historical basis, the forward multiple is closer to 18.5x. I took a large position (relative to my net worth) at $50/share. We're at $65 now, and I still think there's room to run. I read a lot of equity research and JP / William Blair / Barclays has a PT of \~$90.

On the product side, I'm a devout user of their platform. I love the integrated ability to have checking / brokerage all in one place. No fees along with better rates on their own ETFs. Customer support is also out of this world. 

Curious on the communities thoughts - what am I missing?

Understanding bond pricing in IB
I'm trying to understand bonds well using an IB paper account before actually trading. Currently, I'm evaluating foreign bonds in EURO.

When I see a bond like this:

The price 92.535, why would that change? If the interest rate stays the same (0.5% in this case, as per the title name), what is the influence of 92.535?I' trying to understand where that 92.535 comes from. I'm just confused.  


For info: I'm familiar with trading stocks.
Rebalancing portfolio for growth and being tax savvy - is this a good plan?
My fiduciary is proposing rebalancing my portfolio which was inherited and currently focused on wealth maintenance rather than growth, but I’m not experienced and have no clue if what is being suggested makes sense. I’m 43 yr old, will have a pension upon retirement, have around $250,000 in high yield savings, my home is paid, no debt except for around 23k in student loans with low interest. Wife has around 160k in a 401k. 
Main goals for this portfolio are retirement income and I would like to be tax smart:

-BrandywineGLOBAL Corporate Credit
BCGIX MF 15%
-Vanguard Total Bond Market BND ETF 15%
-Vanguard Value VTV ETF 15%
-Apple AAPL Stock 14%
-Berkshire Hathaway BRKB Stock 10%
-Vanguard Health Care VHT ETF 10%
-Vanguard S&P 500 VOO ETF 10%
-Vanguard Total World Market VTV ETF 5%
-Vanguard Utilities VPU ETF 5%
-Fidelity Government Capital Reserves FZAXX
MF 1%

While the portfolio allocation propsed above has historically generated near or above stock market level performance while taking significantly less risk (which is a good thing), one of my concerns for your account is to reposition the assets to a more tax-efficient allocation.  One of the ways to achieve this is in a taxable account using ETF’s for stock-oriented investments as opposed to mutual funds.  Mutual funds are required to pay out to shareholders and capital gain distributions from mutual funds which result in a taxable event.  Over the past two years your  account has generated taxable capital gain distributions of $8,000- $10,000 annually.  ETFs and individual stocks do not have to follow the same tax rules that apply to mutual funds, and therefore instead of paying out capital gain distributions to shareholders, they take the gains generated by the sale of stocks and just purchase more stocks.  Since the capital gain distribution is not paid out to you the result is avoidance of taxation.    
 
The value of a couple stock oriented investments in your account have increased in value so if we were to sell the shares of those investments to rebalance  it would result in a capital gain of approximately $11,000± for 2023 taxes, but then going forward we no longer have those annual tax burdens.

Does the above sound ok? Or what should I be asking him?  I am trying to learn about investing instead of relying on Reddit but it’s a slow process so I appreciate this forum.

Paying off Mortgage with HELOC
Does it make sense to pay off my mortgage with my HELOC? For example, if I have a HELOC for 400,000 and my loan only has 125,000 principal, rates are already shit, and if one was betting they won't go much higher it' almost make sense to pay the mortgage off with the HELOC and no longer be fixed at 7.5% right? Then, as hopefully rates trend down favorably, so will the total interest I pay because I'm no longer fixed and my HELOC trails prime.  Thoughts? Does my way of thinking make sense?  Btw yes I am fixed at 7.5% right now.  
Where can I find a comprehensive list of all U.S. stock market tickers?
Hello everyone,  
I'm in search of a complete list of all tickers for companies listed on the U.S. stock market. Does anyone know of a reliable resource or subreddit where I can find this? Or perhaps any of you have an up-to-date database you'd be willing to share?  
Any assistance would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance!
Analysis tool question: how can I look at my portfolio, which has multiple ETFs, and assess % of individual stocks across whole portfolio? Is there software that can do this?
My portfolio consists of mutual funds, lots of ETFs, and individual stocks.  

While I know my allocation across the asset classes & market segments (e.g. stocks, bonds, xUS, small cap, mid cap, small cap, utilities, tech etc etc etc) I'd like to get more granular.  

Like, I have no idea how much AAPL I own.  I own multiple ETFs that include AAPL but no idea what my actual total ownership is.  

*(Note: yes, I know that owning an ETF is not the same as owning the stock ... I'm just looking for "equivalent net effective ownership" I guess you could say.  Basically just trying to assess my exposure to different individual companies across all my ETFs.)*

Is there any software that I can input my whole portfolio and it can then break everything down in terms of "OK, across all your ETFs, individual stocks, etc ... you "effectively own" $50K of AAPL, 42K of XYZ, 31K of ABC, etc."

My assets are in Schwab and Fidelity ... I've played around and I can't seem to make these sites give me this breakdown.  They can analyze a few ways, but they can't seem to "break open" the ETF to say "yes, you own $100K of SPY ... but that means you effectively own $3K of AAPL" or whatever.

I know I could go into every single ETF fact sheet and pull out the percentages and do the math myself, but this would be a ton of work.
Growth Stocks Ideas Non-Tech
I’ve been trying to help my dad set up a new portfolio. We’ve decided to go with a split between dividends, and value/growth. I’ve taken care of the dividends side of things with him already, but I’m looking for some growth stocks that he can trade short-term (short term being a time interval of a few weeks to a few months or a year or two). I’ve already taken care of the ETFs side of things, so please, stock recommendations only.

However, he seems to not want to invest in many tech companies, so things like AI or TESLA are out of the pictures. I e tried researching online for growth opportunities in other sectors, and have found a few things, but am wondering if any of you might have some suggestions for me to look into.

One final note. I noticed he prefers stocks that have a current share price below $100. Not a dealbreaker, but it’s what he’s more comfortable with I guess. I know it doesn’t really matter, but it’s his call.

Thanks.
Best Robo Advisor? I’m stuck between SoFi and Wealthfront.
I’ve heard great things about both Robo Advisors. Before I use one I want to know which is best. Also, do you all recommend any other Robo advisors such as Fidelity Go? All I’m looking for is something to keep some money in with good APY, and a hands free Robo advisor for beginners that makes good returns.

Thank you.

Apple iPhone sales drop more than forecast, revenue falls for third straight quarter - Yahoo Finance
[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-iphone-sales-drop-more-than-forecast-revenue-falls-for-third-straight-quarter-203804855.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-iphone-sales-drop-more-than-forecast-revenue-falls-for-third-straight-quarter-203804855.html) 

Apple (AAPL) announced its fiscal Q3 earnings after the bell on Thursday, reporting iPhone sales that missed analysts' expectations while **revenue fell 1.4% over last year, the third straight quarter of declines.** About half of the company's overall revenue comes from its iPhone segment.  
  
On Friday, Apple stock was down 2% in premarket trading, as the tech giants gloomy results contributed to it's share price decline.  
  
Revenue has slid for multiple quarters at the tech giant as Mac and iPad sales have flagged. On a call with analysts Apple CFO Luca Maestri said **the company expects revenue for these products to fall by double digits from last year**, citing pent-up demand from the prior year quarter after factory shutdowns.  
  
Services did better however my big question is if this really can compensate if Apple's hardware sales keep slumping? Quite frankly i don't understand why people keep buying the same iphone every year or maybe they no longer do? It's time Apple steps up its iphone and other hardware innovation instead of just repackaging the same thing every year with minor-to-no updates.

PS. anybody else would wanna see a macbook (pro) **with touchscreen**? Personally i love my Dell XPS 13 4K with touchscreen and love the dimensions are only 30x20cm. Would love to see Apple making something similar.

What do you guys think of UIPATH: A $1.249 billion ARR company with high growth rate
The stock traded, in mid of the COVID bubble period, above 80$ and now is trading at 16$ after the stock crashed along with all the SPACs, Cathy Wood's favourites, etc..

I am surprised by the metrics:

Here are the key takeaways from UiPath's Q1 FY2024 earnings results:

* Revenue grew 18% year-over-year to $290 million, ahead of guidance.
* ARR increased 28% to $1.249 billion. Net new ARR was $45 million. Dollar-based net retention rate was 122%.
* GAAP operating loss was $46 million. 
* Non-GAAP operating income was $48 million, representing a 17% operating margin.
* GAAP net loss per share was $0.06. Non-GAAP net income per share was $0.11.Operating cash flow was $67 million and non-GAAP free cash flow was $73 million.
* The company saw continued strong enterprise automation demand and good new customer acquisition.
* Raised full year FY2024 non-GAAP operating income guidance to $168 million, reflecting increasing profitability.Provided Q2 revenue guidance of $279-284 million and ARR of $1.301-1.306 billion

Looking to invest in individual stocks or sector ETFs for 3-5 years then re-invest that into a mutual fund. What taxes/penalties do I pay when I do that conversion/reinvesting?
Hi all, I'm still struggling to understand the right terminology, so I haven't been able to search the web about my question.

Let's say I have $10k right now and I want to invest that in an individual stock or sector ETF - let's just say GOOG and let it sit for 3 years. If it ends up growing to $12K, and I then want to take it out and re-invest it into a mutual fund like FIPFX, what is that process called? And what penalties/fees do I pay on that? Do I pay the capital gains on the $2k gain? Anything else?
Trading Strategy, I'd like Your Perspective (This is version 1 using a DAILY on SPY, and I have good % gains, but I don't think it plays out as good as I think) (GDOC attached)

I backtested for several years daily entries and exits for spy. I only have one loss in the whole bunch since March of 2016, but I do have thing I hold for a long time. It does seem to be more profitable than just holding, but I’m not sure what I can do with this info. I also hold some positions overlapped with each other. They act not as a hedge but just open until the tp hits. On the Shorts, I’d have to trade another ticker with stop losses or options or not at all. Im find just going long.
UK Funds for long term growth
Hey guys,

I'm looking at starting my investment portfolio for long term growth and just want the safety of index funds. But for UK Funds I actually have no idea what the "main" ones are for the UK and not sure where to start looking either.

I'd like some index funds (I believe they're the safest? Correct me if I'm wrong) that pay consistent dividends, monthly or quarterly preferred.

Would love to hear all of your suggestions!

Thanks in advance guys 👍
Semiconductors industry and the evolution of superconductors
With the (ongoing/ in validation) breakthrough on superconductors and the (arguable) over valuation of the semiconductor industry (also impacted by the rise of AI), how do you feel about the future of the semiconductor industry? 

I have some investments in VVSM (Semiconductor ETF) and I’m considering if this current events change my view of the future of the industry enough to make me sell them.
Investing trustfund money (UK)
Hi, I’ve just turned 18 in the UK and have access to my CTF which has a balance of around £7000 held in the form of a matured CTF Stocks & Shares fund invested in 
a fund by Schroders. The company keep emailing me pushing me to convert it into a stocks & shared ISA with them, which I’m reluctant to do because A) I’m unsure whether moving the money will eat into my ISA tax allowance (which I hope to add to this year) and B) I feel like I could move it to a better Stocks & Shares ISA with a higher average return over a 5+ year period. I’ve looked at both the Trading 212 & InvesEngine ISAs for a DIY approach (I would add the best performing Vanguard ETFs) and I also know there are managed accounts such as with Vanguard directly with a monthly fee.
Does anyone have any advice on the best way to go about this and what to do/not do.
Thanks,
Looking for lead exporting companies
I am looking to invest in stocks related to lead production as the LK-99 superconductor seems like a real story to me. 

I have toho zinc and south32 on my list already. I am thinking about investing in Southern Copper aswell, but they seem too diversified in other minerals. I really wanna max out on the lead part. I do not want to invest in chinese companies.

Do you have any recommendations for me?  
  

When we see a stock nosedive and lose 2% in 30 minutes...but then comes back by day end, what the hell is happening?
Why do I see stocks just nosedive huge within 20 minutes and then 2 or 3 days later, its back to where it was?  It HAS to be a big fund (or more than 1) just selling out, right?  Who else could drop the price so quickly other than a big player? It can't be individuals because most of them are working or not paying attention to act so quickly. I wish I could understand the reasons behind why the prices move the way they do in the short term.
529 vs Youth IRA ( or something else) ?
Hi,

So I am.55. I have a 17 year old kid who is really smart and wants to go to University. I haven't exactly had an easy life but have a 401k and traditional IRA. Child is straightaway A's since grade 5 and also saxophone and is in theatre. I am really hoping for a scholarship for them but want to help with more than continuing child support till 21. Oregon only gives a 170 tax credit for a deduction 529 so should I look at other options?

I want for his birthday next week to put some money in an account for Univesity that can help with things outside scholarships.

Thank you for your time.
Should I change my portfolio up?
I am currently 24 and wanting to be agreessive as I’ve got time in the market, I’m currently holding vti and vxus in my Roth IRA. I’m looking for more agreessive growth. One of mine is large blend which I like and foreign large blend, should I just find a better etf in each of those to make my portfolio more agressive, as I should be hitting the us and world market. Or should I just go agressive into the us market.

I’m looking at replacing VTI with XVV or USSG and replace VXUS with maybe BKIE or  EFAX

What do you think?
Should I save up a chunk and go to the bank to open an IRA?
We aren’t huge earners- we are 34 years old and..  
I make 75k as a nurse and husband 40k laborer. We have two kids 12 and 8.  
So total income around $110k  
Mortgage left on house is 55k (approx 350k value home in Pinellas Florida).  
Approx 3k CC balance  
Just bought a car out of absolute necessity (20 year old civic finally died) 40k for 36 months with $1k payment, to get the best possible interest rate.  
Currently paying an extra $750 per month on the house so it should be paid off in less than 5 years.  
We have NO retirement. Neither of our jobs offer 401k or anything. I played around with fidelity but don’t understand it really.  
Any advice on where to start? Should I save up a chunk and go to the bank to open an IRA? I just opened an Ira with Fidelity but don’t understand picking the investment options even after researching.  
Our goals aren’t much- to be able to slow down after the house and car are paid off and kids are grown, and maybe buy a small place in the Carolina’s for the summers. I’m not even sure if this is feasible with our incomes.  
Any guidance is appreciated
What Happened to Embark Technologies?

I invested in Embark Technologies a couple years ago. It was a self-driving truck startup. I haven’t looked at it until now and I saw that during December 2022 it’s stock price actually turned negative. What could cause that to happen? And what does that mean? Does it mean you get paid to buy the stock?
I have $8000 just sitting in TFSA. What should I invest in that is low risk?
I sold my car recently and bought a cheaper one. I don't know anything about investing, but I would like to invest in something very low risk so it's at least not depreciating due to inflation just sitting in my savings. 

I don't want to put it in rrsp (Canadian 401k) since I would like to be able to access it in a few years for a newer vehicle or in case of an emergency.

Is it even worth investing it for 2-5 years in something low risk? Meaning, will it have a significant return in that short amount of time?
Brokerage Account Mechanics
So I am finally at the point where I am serious about my future. I am thinking about opening a brokerage account and investing money in an index fund on a monthly basis. I have a question though. If and when I decide to buy individual stocks in the future, I am assuming I will be using the "same" brokerage account to do this, but will the stocks and their value be added to the value of the index fund as a total, or will they show up as a separate entry (different account) within the brokerage account.

And if the answer is no, is what I am thinking about even possible? Basically the goal from this question (besides learning about brokerage accounts) is to maximize the compounding returns.

Investing in a downturn and suggested portfolio allocations
With the markets showing some volatility and a potential downturn on its way what are safe investments to keep your funds in to avoid big drawdowns?

I’ve heard mention of switching to bonds during downturns. How would you weight your portfolio if you suspect a crash is coming? 

I invest mainly in ETFs - they’re a good option for someone like me who doesn’t have time.
Advice for giving a parent money/income
Hivemind, I'd appreciate some input.

I'm 49, and finally in a place where I'm a stone's throw away from FI.

My mom is 71, single and in excellent health. During my 30's, my mom helped me start my business with a relatively large amount of her own cash. Then in her late 60's she similarly helped my sister. She considered these gifts and has never asked for money in return.

She currently does not have much in the way of savings, is working, and has a house with a smallish mortgage (I do not know the balance owed).

My sister and I want to give her some monthly/yearly money going forward. She has balked a bit, but is finally coming around to the idea. I would love for part of it to be available now, and part later, likely potentially in the form of ROTH contributions or something of that nature. My sister mentioned an annuity, which I raised an eyebrow at because I've never considered annuities a way to go, but would that be a good option for her? We would all like, if possible, for there to be some type of tax advantage to someone, whether immediate or deferred. She stated she would have us as beneficiaries to any funds/accounts.

I am aware of the $17k tax free gift allowance.

Thoughts on the smartest way to tackle this? We want mom to have some of the  freedom and fun she has made available to us!
Am I calculating Oracle's Asset to Equity Ratio wrong?
I'm learning.  For the quarter 5/31/2023, I have Oracle's total assets as 134,384,000 and their shareholder equity as 1,556,000.  So then the asset to equity ratio would be $86.36.  Isn't that very high?  Most other companies I looked at had something around $1-5.  What's the story there?  

Then in 2022, there was negative stockholder equity on the balance sheet.  How can that be a thing?  2021 had an asset to equity ratio of 22.02 and 2020 had one of 9.07.  I think I'm calculating it correctly, but what happened in the company history to cause that?

Vanguard 2060 trust ii best for 401k?
As the title says my company retirement plan is the above trust. I don’t know much about stocks but is this the right place to keep my 401k contributions in or should I switch to some kind of index ??? Would appreciate some pros and cons for both. Thanks in advance
Stay the course or Purchase Property!?
Hi all,

After lurking for many years watching the markets make crazy returns, a few weeks back I put my life savings + an old 401k into ETF’s and a few individual stocks. $100k in the ind bene account and $47k in the rollover IRA. Current total value of $147,000. 

I wanted to sell a few days ago when my account was up $6700 and of course I didn’t and the recent dip has happened and has dropped to leave me barely in the green +$700. I know the timeline for investing is supposed to be 20+ years but I’ve been in the camp of everything is extremely overvalued and I don’t want to watch my money dip 30-40% in the short term. 

I’m 37.. my 401k and wife’s 403b are maxed yearly with another 170k in those accounts and I will never touch those no matter the dips in market. My thought has always been that these will be our true retirement accounts and the other money is just a big savings pot. 


So my question is… Do I… 

A. Just stay the course and leave all my money in the investments? And cry when a big dip happens. 

B. Pull the $100k out of Ind Bene account and tuck into safer HYSA to sit on sidelines another few months while collecting a boring 5%. (While leaving the $47k rollover invested into ETF’s)

C. Buy a property I’ve been looking at for $180k-$200k. Would require all my $100k + a $80k loan. 


I like the idea of the property because even if it dips short term, it’s still mine. It -should- also increase in value over time due to its location near a major city (Houston). BUT, I know by doing this I’m potentially leaving tons of money on the table by not staying with option A if markets continue their 6-10% average returns year after year. 


Ahh life has great decisions. 


I know none of you can make the decision for me but I appreciate the input!
Alternatives to brokerage money market?
What does r/investing do with their brokerage cash when they aren't investing and want to hold cash or cash like liquid assets?

IBKR lite is paying me around 3.2-3.4% interest and I recently increased my cash position to around 75K. I'm still mostly invested in stocks, but I'm wondering if I could do anything else besides sitting on cash or taking it out and putting it into a HYSA if I'm not putting it back into stocks.

I was thinking of allocating to a bond ETF but TLT performance has been bad with a lower yield. Longer treasuries are getting shorted by Ackman which might lead to added risk. I do run a bit of SLV/GLD with covered calls so I don't think I'll add to that since I don't need more exposure with the effort+risk involved for marginal added benefit.
Treasury Bill Roll Over on Treasury Direct question....
Hoping someone can answer a few quick questions about buying t-bills on Treasury Direct....

1. The form on TD website asks you to enter the $ amount of t-bills thst you want to buy. Is that just a proxy for the number of t-bills you want based on $100 par? Or will it buy the max amount possible for the $ amount you enter? For example, will $25k buy 4-week 250 t-bills, or will you buy as many as possible at the auction price (based on last price would be 251 bills)...? 

2. When set it to auto roll and reinvest the maturity into new 4-week bills, does it only roll the principal and give you back the interest? Example, $100 earns $0.41, not enough to buy another bill. So this is deposited back to your account but what if your interest came out to $250? Does it automatically buy 2 more bills or just give you $250 back to your account? 

Thx in advance for the help!

Where can I research historical data on a stock that's no longer traded?
A relative passed away last year. I'm trying to minimize info here for privacy reasons, but ... we found 4 shares he'd bought of a company he worked for in 1987.  That company was bought out by another company in 2009 and the original stock ticker was retired.  Fidelity told me they have absolutely no information about the value, and do not keep historical data (which sounds like complete bullshit to me, but I digress).

Fidelity told me to contact the company who bought out the former, however I'd like to validate as much as I can with publicly available info before calling them.  A Google search tells me the stock was split at least once between 1987 and 2009, which is good, but there's got to be more out there, more of a process for this.

So far we've been told each share is only worth about $150, but the people the executor of the estate talked to didn't know the stock had ever split, they were just quoting the price of the current parent company.  I don't expect they'll be worth a fortune or anything, but I just think there ought to be a way to get more accurate information.  It has to be out there somewhere.

Can anyone help?
AMZN Earnings Report Q2 2023
\*\* I'm for whatever reason, enjoying going through the documents and attempting to make it easier to digest and read. I just started doing this so any feedback would be appreciated. Goal is for a quick overview of the earnings report for an average person to be able to read and digest\*\*

1. Operating Activities:  
The operating activities section of the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows showcases how Amazon generates cash from its core business operations. In both periods, the company's operating activities generated positive cash flow. There was a significant increase in net income, showing growth from a loss of $2.03 billion in the three months ending June 30, 2022, to a profit of $6.75 billion in the same period in 2023. This highlights a remarkable improvement in Amazon's financial performance and operational efficiency.  
  
2. Investing Activities:  
Amazon invested heavily in property, equipment, and strategic acquisitions during the analyzed periods. In the three months ending June 30, 2022, the company's investments in property and equipment amounted to $15.72 billion, which decreased to $11.45 billion in the same period in 2023. While the absolute values decreased, these investments are essential for the company's long-term growth and expansion.  
  
3. Financing Activities:  
The financing activities section details Amazon's capital structure and shareholder returns. The company engaged in various financing activities, including repurchasing common stock, resulting in cash outflows of $3.33 billion in the three months ending June 30, 2023, and $6 billion in the six months ending June 30, 2022. Additionally, the company obtained proceeds from short-term debt and other financing, contributing $4.87 billion and $4.4 billion in the respective three months ending June 30, 2022, and June 30, 2023. Investors should be aware of these activities, as they impact the company's capital allocation strategy.  
  
4. Cash Position:  
Amazon maintained a strong cash position, reflecting its financial stability and liquidity. Cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash increased steadily over the periods, reaching $50.07 billion at the end of the twelve months ending June 30, 2023. This signifies the company's ability to meet its short-term obligations and pursue growth opportunities.  
  
5. Debt and Interest Payments:

Over the six months ending June 30, 2022, and June 30, 2023, operating expenses increased from $230.69 billion to $249.29 billion, primarily due to higher fulfillment, technology, and infrastructure costs.

9. Non-Operating Expense:  
The non-operating expense provides insights into Amazon's other income and expenses outside its core operations. Total non-operating expense decreased from ($5.97) billion to ($0.12) billion in the three months ending June 30, 2022, and June 30, 2023, respectively. This decline was primarily due to a positive swing in other income (expense), net, indicating favorable financial management.  
  
10. Net Income (Loss):

Diluted earnings per share showed similar growth, rising from a loss of ($0.20) to $0.65 for the same periods.  
  
12. Other Comprehensive Income (Loss):  
Other comprehensive income (loss) includes items that impact the company's financial position but are not part of the net income calculation.

The company's operating activities generated positive cash flow, and net sales increased consistently across all segments. Investments in property, equipment, and strategic acquisitions reflect Amazon's focus on long-term growth and expansion.

PROs & CONs:  
Pros:  
  
•	Strong Revenue Growth: Amazon has consistently demonstrated strong revenue growth across its various segments. The company's ability to expand its customer base, introduce new products and services, and leverage its e-commerce platform has led to impressive financial performance.  
•	Diversification of Business Segments: Amazon has successfully diversified its business beyond e-commerce. The expansion into cloud computing through Amazon Web Services (AWS) has been a major growth driver, providing the company with a stable and profitable source of revenue.  
•	Innovative and Customer-Centric Approach: Amazon's relentless focus on customer satisfaction, innovative technologies like Amazon Prime, and personalized shopping experiences have helped the company build a loyal customer base and maintain a competitive edge in the market.  
•	Financial Stability and Liquidity: The company maintains a strong cash position and prudent debt management, providing it with the financial flexibility to invest in new ventures and navigate economic uncertainties.  
•	Global Reach: Amazon operates in numerous countries, allowing it to tap into diverse markets and consumer preferences worldwide. Its vast international presence positions the company for further growth and market dominance.  
•	Leading Cloud Service Provider: AWS is a dominant force in the cloud computing industry, serving a wide range of clients, from startups to large enterprises. The profitability and growth of AWS contribute significantly to Amazon's overall financial success.  
  
Cons:  
  
•	Regulatory Scrutiny: Amazon faces increasing regulatory scrutiny related to its market dominance and business practices. Antitrust concerns and accusations of unfair competition may lead to potential legal challenges and fines.  
•	Labor Practices: The company has faced criticism for its labor practices, including allegations of poor working conditions and treatment of employees at its fulfillment centers. Such negative publicity can impact Amazon's reputation and may affect its ability to attract and retain talent.  
•	Highly Competitive Markets: The e-commerce and cloud computing industries are highly competitive, with major players vying for market share. Amazon faces challenges from established competitors and emerging startups, requiring continuous investment in innovation and technology.  
•	Dependence on Global Supply Chain: Amazon's vast supply chain network is critical for delivering products to customers. Any disruptions, such as those caused by geopolitical events or natural disasters, could affect the company's operations and financial performance.  
•	Profit Margins: While Amazon experiences strong revenue growth, its profit margins have historically been relatively low. Intense competition and ongoing investments in new ventures can put pressure on the company's profitability.  
•	Environmental Impact: As a large-scale retailer and cloud services provider, Amazon's operations have an environmental impact. The company has faced criticism for its carbon footprint, and there are growing expectations from stakeholders for more significant efforts towards sustainability.  
TLDR;  
Amazon recent earnings report for the periods ending June 30, 2022, and June 30, 2023, reveals a robust financial performance and impressive revenue growth across its segments. The company generated positive cash flow from operating activities, showing a significant increase in net income, indicating improved financial health and operational efficiency. Amazon's strategic investments in property, equipment, and acquisitions demonstrate a focus on long-term growth and expansion. With a strong cash position and responsible debt management, the company exhibits financial stability and flexibility. However, regulatory scrutiny, labor practices, and intense competition pose potential challenges. Despite these, Amazon remains a leading player in the e-commerce and cloud computing industries, presenting attractive prospects for investors seeking exposure to a market-dominant, innovative, and customer-centric company with a history of success and growth.  

Small Free Float -- Is it allowed to buy 30% of the free float / 3% of a company?
Hello,

Basicly what the title says. If a US company only has a 10% free float and say a $200m market cap, so $20m free float. Can I buy say $6m of that free float without issues? Would I have to report the stake or not?

Assuming there is only 1 share class; common shares.

Keep hearing it would be far more in my interest to invest in an IRA rather than have my
money sit in a savings account barely collecting interest. I’m 26 and would like to know which ones you guys think are the most beneficial? Thank you tons in advance!
Wealth Management Conversion to Roboadvisor (taxable and tax advantaged) Questions
Hi,

I’ve been unhappy with my wealth manager’s performance at a big firm (think merrill/UBS/Barclay’s) vs the S&P 500 and his lack of knowledge on other items.  I  thought about moving to the 3 fund portfolio but I don’t want to re-balance and move stuff around.  I’d prefer to set it and forget it.

I’ve decided to pay the .25% fee for a robo, but I’m curious how it will work.  For taxable accounts, will I pay a lot of taxes converting to a robo like Wealthfront?  Technically, will I have to sell all my positions in merrill/UBS and then take the cash and throw it in the Robo?

For tax-advantaged accounts, I assume I can’t use a robo and will have to open up a Fidelity or Vanguard account? Again, if I choose to convert to a target fund, will it be expensive converting whatever my advisor had selected in Merrill/UBS?
What's the best investment tool in a country with hyperinflation and manipulated inflation figures?
The situation is as follows: 

The government's inflation figures are far below reality. In a situation where real inflation is 122% annually, the announced inflation is only around 40%. The policy rate is even worse, around 17.5%. In such a situation, people do not know how to protect their money against inflation. 

In this situation, the exchange rate is also constantly increasing, but not as much as inflation. The stock market, on the other hand, is always increasing in the long run, but most companies do not increase as much as inflation and at the same time their value in dollar mostly decreasing. Government bonds and interest rates offer returns far below real inflation, so investing money there is a futile endeavor. 

So, how should one plan an investment that preserves the value of money as much as possible?

Checking/savings account distribution
What's a good thumb rule you follow to distribute your 'sitting' funds? My bank provides checking + savings account and I feel like I have a lot more money just sitting there in checking, rather than atleast earning more dividends through savings. Now I do have investments into ETFs, Index funds, mutual funds and stocks so this really is just idle money which technically I am saving for a house in the future. 
I'm thinking of the following logic to come up with how I should balance the two accounts. 
Keep emergency funds (6 months worth of rent, expenses + 10%) in checking and move the rest to savings. Followed by periodically balancing the ratio by moving surplus checking money to savings. 
Sounds right?
Keep Wealthfront allocation or move to 3 fund portfolio?
I opened an account with wealthfront many years ago when I first started investing and had been making recurring deposits. They completely determined the allocation of the portfolio based on my risk factor.
I recently opened a fidelity account and have been depositing there instead, just buying FSKAX.  
I plan on moving my current holdings from Wealthfront to Fidelity to reduce fees, but should I transfer and keep the current portfolio as is? Or sell Wealthfront's portfolio and instead do a 3-fund portfolio for simplicity (70% FSKAX/20% FTIHX/ 10% FXNAX)?

current holdings:
FIDELITY TOTAL MARKET INDEX FUND FSKAX	31%
Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF	VTI	12%
Schwab U.S. Broad Market ETF	SCHB	12%
Schwab International Equity ETF	SCHF	11%
State Street Barclays Capital Muni TFI	7%
iShares Core MSCI Emerging Markets ETF IEMG 6%
Vanguard FTSE Emerging Markets ETF VWO	5%
State Street Energy Select Sector ETF XLE 5%
Vanguard FTSE Developed Markets ETF VEA	4%

Investment Breakdown Help
So, through my work we have investments (similar to 401k, but I am in Canada). I know a bit about investing and I do some investing with my personal money, but since this money is matched by my company, I need to leave it in this account. With that being said, I can adjust the % of contribution towards different investments. This is what it currently is. Any suggestions? With this layout, I've gotten a 6.5% return YTD.

&#x200B;

Income Funds 19.062% (14.342% Bonds & 4.720% Global Fixed Income PIMCO)

Canadian Equity Funds 40.142% (17.863% Dividend, 18.095% Canadian Equity Growth & 4.184% Canadian Equity Small Cap)

Should I cash out my I-Bonds?
I purchased $5,000 in I-Bonds a little while ago. I've only made a little bit of money. My current holding is $5,172.  Would it be a better idea to cash out and put this money into my Roth IRA? I'm a single 30 yr old female. I also have student loans that I plan on paying off this fall. Thank you! 
Which investment profession will be replaced by AI or ML technology ?
***Which profession will be Impacted more by artificial intelligence ?***  
  
*From Bailey Schulz USA Today 8/4/23*  
  
Which jobs are most at-risk due to AI?  
  
U.S. jobs likely to have *high, medium and low exposure* to AI include:  
  
**High exposure:**  
  
Budget analysts  
  
Data entry keyers  
  
Tax preparers  
  
Technical writers  
  
Web developers  
  
**Medium exposure:**  
  
Chief executives  
  
Veterinarians  
  
Interior designers  
  
Fundraisers  
  
Sales managers  
  
**Low exposure:**  
  
Barbers  
  
Child care workers  
  
Dishwashers  
  
Firefighters  
  
Pipelayers  
  
In sum, about 19% of U.S. workers were in jobs most exposed to AI last year, while an even greater share (23%) had jobs considered least exposed.    
  
It's not clear how many jobs will be displaced by AI. A March report from Goldman Sachs found AI could substitute up to 25% of current work, with about two-thirds of jobs exposed to "some degree" of automation.  
  
But researchers note that displacements following the emergence of new technology have typically been offset by the creation of new jobs, with census data suggesting that about 60% of workers today are employed in jobs that didn't exist in 1940.  
  
Which employees are most at risk?  
  
Pew found that women, Asian, college-educated and higher-paid workers are more exposed to AI.   
  
Kochhar said this is because of the types of jobs held by different demographics: men tend to hold more jobs requiring physical labor like construction, for instance.  
  
"So at the moment, they have less exposure to AI," Kochhar said. "Which is not to say AI could not lead to smarter robots that can do it all, also. That's not something we looked into."  
  
According to the report:  
  
Workers with a bachelor’s degree (27%) are more likely than those with only a high school diploma (12%) to hold a job with the most exposure to AI.  
  
Women (21%) are more likely than men (17%) to have jobs with the most exposure to AI.  
  
Black (15%) and Hispanic (13%) workers are less exposed than Asian (24%) and white (20%) workers.   
  
Workers in the most exposed jobs last year earned $33 per hour on average, while jobs with the least amount of exposure earned $20 per hour.  
  
Despite warnings from AI company executives that the technology will take away jobs, many workers – especially those with jobs considered highly exposed to AI – are optimistic about AI's impact.  
  
Thirty-two percent of information and technology workers ‒ who work in an industry that is considered more exposed to AI ‒ say the technology will help more than hurt them compared with 11% who believe the opposite.   
  
Meanwhile, 14% of workers in hospitality, services and arts – a “less exposed” industry – think AI will help more than hurt. A greater share (17%) believe it's more likely to hurt them.  
  
"Where AI has penetrated at the moment, workers are finding it being more useful than hurtful or businesses are applying in what that is benefiting workers as opposed to replacing workers," Kochhar said.  
  
Overall, 16% of U.S. adults said they think AI will help more than hurt, while 15% said they thought it would hurt more than help. Thirty percent say it will help and hurt equally, and 32% said they were unsure.

What math should I learn to really understand finance & the economy?
I know I don’t technically need to learn all the math & that I can hire someone to help me make financial & investing decisions, but I’d really like to have a deep & full understanding of the topics. Currently, I’m in the art college of a much larger University so I was only required to take a general math class that was basically just highschool math, i.e a general overview of stuff like algebra, a bit of trigonometry, some differential equations, etc. Right now I’m working on getting better at mental math & more complex algebra, then I’m moving into to teaching myself calculus, and then statistics, but do I need anything else?

EDIT: I was pretty vague. I don’t have a specific goal with any of this, I mostly just want to learn bc I find it really interesting. I have ADHD so math feels really good on my brain after a long day of having to be creative. I would say my main focus is a bit more on investing & personal finance as of right now but ideally I’d like to learn as much as possible about any & all fields of finance & Econ.
Strategy Identifying Best Targets for Covered Calls
Long post, but if you like options and making money you may find it interesting.

I've got about a $500k portolfio I'm playing with. I've had my fun gambling with options over the last 5 or 6 years, understand the concepts and general strategies, but now want to "settle down" and try to maximize my return with a more boring strategy. I've put a good bit of thought into it and started executing some over the last 6 months, want to lay out what I'm thinking, and see if anyone has any critiques or comments, basically see if it's as good of an idea as I think it is. For reference, about half of my portfolio is in the general ETFs (SPY, QQQ, etc), the other half in individual stocks that I like for one reason or the other.

So far I haven't really sold any covered calls on the ETFs because the premium hasn't been attractive enough. They aren't volatile enough. Feels like picking up pennies in front of a steam roller. But I have strongly considered starting to, and just rolling over indefinitely if needed. Will come back to this later in the post.

What I have been doing is waiting until some of my individual stock picks are near what I think of as near term "peaks" and selling covered calls on them about 10-20% OTM about 45 days out. I don't expect to get assigned, but when it's close to expiration and I would be assigned because they have turned ITM, I have just been rolling them over. I haven't been selling covered calls on stocks in my portfolio that I think are in a low point in their mid-term cycle because I don't want to limit their upside.

More on the rollovers. For example, I bought SCHW at $52, sold call on it with a $60 strike, jumped to $67 at earnings. Bought to close my call at $60, sold to open another at $62.5 with an expiry 2.5 months later for the same price per contract I bought to close my $60 call. Doing this I'm essentially making $250 for waiting 2.5 months if SCHW price stays elevated. With SCHW in particular I think I calculated that even if it goes up to $100 per share, I'm still making like 12% per year just on the rollovers not counting the initial 15% gain from 52-60, it will eventually catch up, and I'm protected from a lot of downside risk unless it just plummets because I'm holding deep ITM calls. Seems like a win-win-win?

Now the above returns are because SCHW is relatively volatile. I sold covered calls on AMZN this morning after the earnings spike because the math is similar. Back to the ETFS... I almost sold covered calls on SPY this morning too, but did the math and my rollovers look like they would only gain 5% a year, instead of the 12%+ on AMZN and SCHW. Not to mention I have to sell the initial call much closer to the money to be worth anything signficant. With a spike in the S&P I could see myself being "underwater" and having to rollover for years limited to the sub-par 5% gains and missing out on the broader market movement.

Soo... investors that are smarter than me, does all this make sense? Is the strategy sound or am I missing something? It's probably just a typical covered call strategy, but I don't see it being talked about very much.
Stock rollover to IRA or 401k
I am eligible for a distribution from an employee stock program at work. It’s a pre tax program. I have too much of my portfolio in this one stock so I’m going to do it. 

I can roll it directly to my company 401k or my IRA. Both at Fidelity.  I don’t see much difference between the two in terms of fees/costs. I guess the IRA would give me more investment options, but I’m pretty much a three fund guy so it’s not a huge advantage to me. 

Any reason I’m not considering to choose one over the other?
Sell of stocks and pay off 401K loan or let it ride?
I have a 401K loan that I took out last year for a kitchen remodel. This adds up to basically an extra 401K contribution every week in the amount of $270 per paycheck (biweekly). I'm not losing money on it as I'm paying myself back with interest. I can pay it all off today if I sell off my stock portfolio (which is doing...OK) or I can see which way the market takes me in the coming months/years.  
My port...  
AMZN, TSLA, AAPL, NVDA, AMD (safe)  
PLTR, TMC, IONQ (risky)  
Distribution is 80/20 (safe/risky)  
Total earnings as of now - 8%
iShares market outlook removed
iShares/Blackrock used to have a section where they have a kind-of power index of regions (Europe, US, Emerging Markets, etc.) and investment types (bonds, funds) does anyone know why they removed it and is there something similar to it on the market?
Opened Roth 401k with company, did I make a mistake?
Hey everyone, I (25m) am finally eligible for my employer match at my company. I decided it was time to open a 401k with them, and I chose a Roth 401k rather than a Pretax 401k. Was this a mistake? (I currently have a Roth IRA, which I max out. The idea of not having to pay taxes on my retirement funds when eventually withdrawn is what made my decision.)

I’m looking to roll over my previous Pretax 401k funds into this Roth 401k, and understand I will need to pay taxes on the funds. It is a low amount, so I’m not very worried about this.

Additionally, my investment elections breakdown is as follows:

- Vanguard 500 Index (30%)
- Vanguard Extended Market Index (25%)
- Vanguard Mid-Cap Growth Index (30%)
- MFS International Value (15%)

 Any feedback would be greatly appreciated - wondering I should’ve just chosen a Target Retirement fund.

EDIT: I make about 90k pretax, and don’t have too much room for growth in my current position.
Maxing out my Roth IRA is ~10% of my take home, and contributing 5% to my Roth 401k will be about 5% of my salary (lol, I actually went to do the math).
Question about using a broker to buy CDs and T-bills
I’d like to buy a significant amount of CDs and T-bills and ladder both. I have a US treasury account since I previously purchased some I-Bonds and I can buy CDs myself, but I really just want to give it all over to my broker to buy and keep up with it all.  I know it’s being lazy, but my question is are there any downsides to a broker handling these CDs and Tbills other than the added fees that I should be aware of?  Thanks
VOO and VIG redundant or ok?
I am holding both VOO and VIG as my only etf holdings. My individual stocks consists of AAPL, PG, KO, BAC, ABBV, AXP, XOM, and KHC). Do I need to keep both VOO and VIG or should I part ways with one? I would like to have a combination of growth and dividends. I do like SCHD but like holding individual stocks better. This is ina regular brokerage account. I am in my early 40s and and I do have an ira thru work invested in a target retirement fund thru Vanguard. I welcome any suggestions.
How do analysts come up with such accurate earnings estimates?
Forget about target stock price, which we know analysts are often wrong about. What I’m surprised at is how their EPS and revenue estimates usually come very close to the actual report.

Is this something they do with public data? Or are they using private research data like shipping containers, credit card company info, etc.?

How would you come up with next quarter’s Apple’s earnings numbers, as a concrete example?
Hiding wealth from your children
If you became very wealthy and had children, how would your level of wealth impact there lives? Would you buy them newer and nicer things, give them the best education, different lifetsyle, expensive and big house? Or would it be okay to hide your wealth until they are much older like 30's 40's once they've established careers and found someway to contribute to the world?

Generational wealth almost never makes it past the 3rd generation and there must be someway to break this.
What do you guys think about Robinhoods new announcement: 3% IRA match for gold members. Worth it?
Robinhood announced in their earnings call yesterday that they are increasing the IRA match for gold members from 1% to 3%, which seems huge, especially if it’s applicable to 401k transfers like the current 1% match is. What do you guys think of it? Worth it?
HYSA in CHF (swiss francs)
I'm looking for some advice on finding a High Yield Savings Account (HYSA) that supports Swiss Francs (CHF) without requiring me to change currencies, which would create currency risk. I want to keep my funds in CHF to avoid any unnecessary exchange rate fluctuations. Any recommendations or experiences with such accounts? Your insights would be highly appreciated! Thanks in advance! 🙏
Who reaps the profits on sale of Zyns in the US?
From what I've been reading, Philip Morris International owns/sells Marlboro's outside the US, and Altria inside the US. 

I know Philip Morris Intetnational bought the Swedish company that owns ZYNs, but if PMI only operates/sells outside the US, who sells/makes money on sale of ZYNs in the US? I've been scouring trying to find this info, but cant seem to find it
When do you decide to sell a stock?
I threw $40 at a retailer I like a couple of years back. Since then it has grown to $106.90, a 167.25% gain. At the time I was throwing small amounts of cash toward stocks on Robinhood and losing my ass due to volatility. 

Is it time to cash out and invest in a few more? How much more can this really gain?
Should I Create Small Roth IRA Anyway to Start Clock, And Take Penalty?
I don't qualify for a Roth IRA due to income and too much in traditional IRA. Plus, I don't want to roll back IRA to Company 401K. Should I create a ROTH IRA anyway with $1K to start the clock?  


Background - I posted regarding new 401k rules coming next that will force $7.5K catch up into a Roth 401k.  I'm game for that.  But if I rollover my Roth 401K to a new Roth IRA when retire, the clock starts over.   My thinking is if I roll it into an existing Roth IRA, I should have immediate access w/o penalty. 
Liquid vs Less Liquid T-Bills
I came across this article: 

[https://districtcapitalmanagement.com/how-to-build-a-treasury-bill-ladder/](https://districtcapitalmanagement.com/how-to-build-a-treasury-bill-ladder/)

And am unsure, what this sentence means:

"6-month and 12-month T-Bills are often referred to as “on-the-run” T-bills because they are the most liquid. 1 month, 3 months, and 9 months are often referred to as “off-the-run” as they are less liquid and they are not as attractive to investors."

How can 1 Tbill be less liquid than the other?

ELI5 - expense ratio on Fidelity Money market funds
I’ve been looking for a HYSA to put about $25k in for a rainy day fund. It’s becoming really obnoxious to wade through the qualifications for these 5%+ APY accounts (i.e. transactions required, deposits required per month, amount to keep promo rates).

I saw someone mention in another post that they use fidelity money market funds instead of HYSA. The expense ration on these accounts are really high vs ETF’s (.4%~). I’m used to seeing ETFs at .02%-.09%. 

Here’s my questions:

1- Why is the expense ration so much higher?

2- Is there an expense ratio on HYSA’s, other than potential fees the bank may have? I haven’t seen one but digging through the terms is confusing.

3- ELI5 expense ratios in general. 

4- Most importantly, suggestions for either banks or other options to hold money that’s easy to access, while still making a decent return on the money.

Thanks in advance.
Are equities actually overvalued? Or is it something else…
This is something I’ve discussed with friends and thought about for the past few years.

TL;DR Does having more investors than ever before and faster opportunities for companies to grow account for the “outrageous multiples” we see?

I believe the average PE of the S&P is somewhere around 25 with tech closer to 45, book value is at an ATH; you don’t need a DCF on the entire US market to see equities are trading at what history would tell us are high multiples.

With that in mind, I can’t help but think about the amount of new money that’s been brought in in the last 20 years as ease of access to investing, as well as financial savvy has grown. I mean look at the market cap of the US market here:

https://siblisresearch.com/data/us-stock-market-value/

Combine and contrast that to the speed of information from 1980-2000s vs now. Companies can excel or fail at exponentially faster rates as a result of the marketing tools, analysis, and direct-to-consumer technologies available.

Are we just in a new norm as a result of these things? I’m not saying the market isn’t overvalued but is it AS overvalued as analysts think or should we be adjusting our baselines?

Thanks in advance for your inputs. Cheers!
Empty Roth IRAs to Pay Off Rental?
Hi all,

I currently live in a 3 bed 2 bath house close to town. House is worth about 300k, and I owe 66k on it at 3.5% (bought in 2014 as a forclosure and fixed up ourselves). My family is growing so I'm considering buying a new house for about 500k. With interest rates what they are, the new mortgage is larger than I'd like at about 3400 including taxes (with 20% cash being put down). 

I want to keep the existing home as a long term rental. The mortgage payment on it is about $760 per month and comparable homes rent for $1800-2000 here. 

Although I make a good salary, I'm a bit uncomfortable with the risk involved in carrying a $400k mortgage (at 7%) on the new house plus a $66k mortgage in the rental. I am considering pulling my money out of my Roth and my wife's Roth to pay off the mortgage on the rental as the combined balance of those is about what we owe on the "rental". Our return from the Roths has been about 8.2% over the past couple years. 

I know this generally frowned upon, but paying this off would mean I have a $300,000 property generating about $1900 in cash flow each month with no debt service. And my risk would be substantially lower. My other option is to squeek by on my monthly expenses and let the mortgage be paid down over time. 

For reference, the Roths are 100% in VTSAX and I am 34 years old. I also have a 401k at work, so these are not my only retirement funds. 

Thanks in advance for the help thinking through this.
What would be the best way to invest 5k to make fast money safely?
EDIT: When I say fast I don’t mean overnight or even within a year. I mean I don’t want to wait 30 years. I’m thinking 5k to 10k within a year or two or 5k to 25k within 5 years - WHILE ALSO CONTRIBUTING MONTHLY TO THE ORIGINAL 5K - I’m aware I’m not using “proper” wording to explain what I mean, I’m new at this, please bear with me. 

EDIT 2: When I say “no high risk”/“safely” that doesn’t mean I’m only open to low risk/no risk investing. I’m willing to look into mild to moderate risk investments I just don’t want to do high risk bc I don’t want to end up like the 95% of day traders that fail & lose all their money. 

I’m a college student & I’m looking to start investing to pay off my student loans. I took out a few smaller loans the first 3 years that total to about $17,000. I’m not worried about these bc I have money set aside to pay for them either lump sum or with in 2 years. 

However, I have to take out an additional $32,000 loan to pay for my final year by myself. I’m doing an internship right now and my total earnings r projected to be around $10,000 by the end if I continue putting 75% of my paycheck into my HYSA. I also have another couple of thousands in another savings account under my parents names. The loan I’m looking at right now would have me paying around $400 a month while in school so I would be left with around $5,000 in my main savings account by the time I graduate. I really don’t want to end up paying $10,000 in interest or have to be making payments for 10+ years so I’ve been researching ways I could invest the spare $5,000 now. I would be adding to it monthly somewhere between $200 - $400. 

I’ve been looking into ETFs & mutual funds but to my understanding unless you’re investing large sums of money these investments don’t grow very fast. I don’t want to get into day trading/scalping or anything high risk bc I can’t really afford to lose money right now nor do I have the money to fund this type of investing. I know about CDs as well but from what I’ve seen they don’t make much at all. I get that I can use a compound investing strategy but are there any types of investing that are considered more middle of the road? Or types of investing strategies that are more aggressive?

UPDATE: If you left a rude comment without any additional feedback, your mama a hoe & u weren’t raised right. You joined this sub to learn, give advise, & share information, not insult & shame people. My interest in finance only started a few days ago and obviously I don’t have the knowledge y’all have, that’s why I came here to ask a question. 

However, I’m sticking to my HYSA and adding monthly for now to reach my goal of paying off my loans fast. I’m also going to start buying t bills & some CDs to get comfortable with the market, then move up to ETFs when I have a bit more saved up to throw around. Big thanks to anyone that was actually helpful.
Has anyone else increased their bond position this year?
I’m pretty conservative with my personal savings ( money in the bond market) vs my work investments which are all in S&P500 index funds. Am I wrong for this? I have over $200k in the bonds conservative accounts just because it’s my own hard earned money hopefully yielding 4-8% a year. What do you think about that decision?

Great video as always, underlining that complex products are usually created by banks to trick investors into paying more fees. Their expected return is much lower than the underlying assets without doing much to actually mitigate risk.

Downside protection in those products are usually much more expensive than expected returns, and most of them are sold by financial advisor getting a commission from it... So it's a good baseline to simply not buy them!

**This is my first time doing this and I’d like some insight on what to include or better construct an overview such as this. Goal is to produce fairly easy to read overview on earnings reports for average persons to digest and highlight the more important information found**
How do you think climate change will impact returns on large index funds like S&P500?


When it comes to investing for my retirement that is 30 years away, do you think Climate change will cause a serious impact on say the S&P500 vs historical averages? 

On one hand, I’m worried returns will plummet as the economy struggles with the destruction of climate change. 

On the other hand, businesses should continue to find and make profits as they have through all previous disasters this past century. 

Past returns don’t predict future, yes, but after a century of ~10% over long periods it’s seems like a fair benchmark. 

Are we going maintain, exceed, or fall below?
investing in TLT for mid term
is it good idea to buy TLT now and if it falls buy again.

FED will cut rates in the next few quarters. By summer 2024 inflation will fall to 2% or even below. This will be the main campaign for the elections also.

Do you think the yields are already too high at the moment so they should start to fall and TLT will rise?

Question about stock ticker symbol
First off, if this is the wrong sub, please direct me.

When I look at NVDA after hours, the at-close price today is 1.100T. After trading is still going on. Other stocks I noticed had the gain/loss number followed by a B. What do these letter symbols  mean?
Anybody have any thoughts/explanations for agency bonds? Interest rate right now is 6.00% for 20 year agency Federal Home Loan Baser Bonds - idea is buy them as interest rates are likely at all time high, a bit confused why agency bonds are higher than corporate bonds though
Pretty much in the title. Currently can get new issue 6.00% 20 year Federal Home Loan Baser bonds roughly.

My understanding is the Federal Home Loan Banks, although private, are essentially a government created network (or at least government sanctioned network) created through the Federal Home Loan Bank Act. They focus on community lending, mainly residential mortgages. Their bonds are considered agency bonds and have a rating of AAA to AA+. During 2008, although they took a financial hit, they were strong enough so as not to require a government bailout. *See* [*https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fhlb.asp*](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fhlb.asp)

With interest rates high and only another 0.25% federal interest rate increase expected as inflation is reacting as expected, current new issues of Federal Home Loan Basers are  6.00% interest rate which are available to retail through most brokers in $1,000 bond increments. 

This seems like a pretty good deal. Buy a 20 year bond at what are likely high interest rates so likely an expectation that interest rates will go down from the 6.00% interest rate bonds currently being issued. Lock in a 6.00% yield. If interest rates go down then the value of the bonds will go up as you buy them 20 years out so a decrease in interest rate will have more of an impact on the bond value. **It seems the only major downside of these bonds is that they are callable, although not util July 2025**. 

**Does anybody have any thought on these Federal Home Loan Bank Baser bonds, including how of often the Federal Home Loan Bank actually calls these bonds?**

How to not lose out on interest between CD Maturity and finding a new one?
Hi all! 

In this higher interest rate environment, I have been using CDs for the first time in my life. I use fidelity as my brokerage. 

I deposited my cash into a 1 month CD in July, which matures 8/24. I got it at 5.15%. 

My question is, is there any way to avoid simply have my money sitting in cash between 8/24 maturity, cash settlement, and depositing into a new one? If I continue buying short term CDs, this is effectively a loss in 20-25% of return if it sits for a week due to the time it takes cash to settle and whatnot. 

Apologies if im being dense - I am new to this approach and generally newer to investing in general (I am 25). Thanks in advance!
Gallium producers to invest in (that are not sanctioned in the US)?
**Disclaimer:** None of this is investment advice, don't do any investing based on what random people say on reddit. I know I'm not smart and can't do better than real analysts, probably you aren't either. I intend to invest a tiny amount of money on this strategy which I can afford to lose. The most likely amount of money I will invest in this strategy is $0. I have no Gallium-related investments right now.

**Background:** I don't agree with the CSIS on a lot of their descriptive or prescriptive geopolitics, but they have an interesting report on Gallium production: [https://www.csis.org/analysis/understanding-chinas-gallium-sanctions](https://www.csis.org/analysis/understanding-chinas-gallium-sanctions).

I was thinking that it could be fun to invest in some of the (potential) Gallium producers mentioned (directly or indirectly) in that report, in case they benefit from higher prices, higher demand, or higher (government?) investment. So here are my questions:

1. **General thoughts?**
2. The CSIS report gives an example Japanese Gallium recycler. **Any thoughts on the biggest or most interesting Gallium recyclers?** (that are not sanctioned in the US)
3. The CSIS report gives an example (publicly traded) Japanese Gallium refiner. **Any thoughts on the biggest or most interesting Gallium refiners?** (that are not sanctioned in the US) What about [Rasa Industries](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/4022.T/) (the one mentioned in the report)?
4. The CSIS report mentions some companies that might be likely to start Gallium production/recovery. Any thoughts on companies like this?
What stops companies overestimating their pricing power?
I have a handful of shares in McDonalds, as I believe in their ability to weather (and actually gain) from economic downturns. I noticed this morning that my cup of McDonald's coffee has gone up in price by about 5%.

Although I'm no expert in the hospitality sector, I'd imagine there's a natural limit that consumers will pay for a coffee from a fast food chain, before they'll just go to say, Starbucks.

My question is, how do companies - particularly in this era of inflation - avoid overestimating their pricing power, and thus driving down sales with higher prices?

Heineken appears to have made this mistake, with higher prices and falling volumes, although their CEO [defended](https://www.marketingweek.com/heineken-defends-price-increases-despite-volume-drop/) their decision, saying “Brand power today is pricing power tomorrow.”

(Yes, Heineken, but you've flexed your pricing power today, not tomorrow!)
JNJ Conversion to Kenvue Discussion
July 24 (Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N) said on Monday it had launched an exchange offer under which its stockholders can opt for shares of Kenvue <KVUE.N>, its newly listed consumer health unit.

J&J, which currently owns an 89.6% stake in Kenvue, said it intends to split off at least 80.1% of the consumer health company's shares as part of the offering.

The offering will help J&J move a step closer in its plan to spin off the unit and focus on its larger medical devices and pharmaceuticals businesses.

https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/jj-begins-share-exchange-offer-consumer-health-spin-off-kenvue-2023-07-24/

I haven’t seen/heard much discussion around this topic so was curious on thoughts from the group. I’m not looking for analysis.
TPVG stock price help me understand please
I bought about $3400 of this stock a while back. Generally I like the company, it’s payouts and dividends.

I did look at its history and noticed that every so many days, not coinciding with the dividend, that the price will have sudden drops. 

I was up about 22% last week and decided to buy put options to cover my profit margin solely because by my math in the next 5-15 days the price would drop.

Yesterday the company BEAT earnings expectations and nothing but great news came out. Today the stock opened at about 15% down.

Why? Am I missing something here? The puts paid out and i essentially cashed in my profit but I sincerely don’t understand.
Investing SE Asia growth. What are my options? Including some less traditional ones.

I see that in the last 1-2 decades, there was a tremendous growth in SE asia region. China, Indonesia, Vietnam, singapore, taiwan, in extension korea, india, ...

It grew maybe 10 times in those 1-2 decades. I want to participate on that growth. However, traditional investments such as mutual funds or ETFs focused to that region failed to capture that growth (perhaps because their stock markets are not capturing it, maybe because growth is not primarily in their publicly traded corporations...and they underperformed sp500 index funds. 

So, what ARE the options to participate in that growth? How? Why? what vehicles and strategies would you propose? Are you happy with any of them?
Confused how Treasury Bills work
I recently purchased a bunch of short term Treasuries with a severance package I got, 4 week notes CUSP ID 912797GJ0 that state they had 5.385% yields. But the first 4 week renewal hit and it auto-renewed (set it to do this 12 times/1 year) - but the balance of my account has not increased at all.

I read some more and it says it lets you purchase them at a discount and the interest is not what interest generally is, but it does not appear that I have any more money than I started with. Am I a goof or is this false advertising by the US Government?
Do share prices tend to shift a lot around large market events?
Let's take tech as an example. Let's say that Google is going to releases Gadget A, and there is tons of investor speculation about that. Google's stock should rise right? 

That's a very simple example, but I'm also thinking of real life historical events like the release of the Stadia (I'm uncertain if that affected prices) 

Or a non-tech example...let's take the movie Free Guy. It did well in the USA, would it's theatrical successes in other countries have an impact on 21th Century Studios stock?

While I don't believe in market timing per se, I do follow certain industries quite closely and would like to see if that knowledge can be utilized in picking stocks. "Buy what you know" (although Lynch also meant doing your due diligence and reading company material, of course) 
Is the Shiller PE Ratio a reliable method of valuation?
The Shiller PE Ratio, also known as the CAPE ratio, is 31 as of August 3, 2023.  
[https://www.multpl.com/shiller-pe](https://www.multpl.com/shiller-pe)  


Is the ratio no longer relevant in today's market?

Each time the ratio exceeded 27, gold, not the S&P 500, turned out to be the superior value for approximately the next 2 decades. Is now the time to get gold?
US: steepening yield curve ETF?
Hi all,

In Europe there are two ETF tradeable that benefit from a steepening yield curve. 

Lyxor US Curve Steepening 2-10 ETF (WKN: LYX00G)

Ossiam US Steepener Fonds (WKN: A2PKUL)

However those are EU ETF. 

Is there an equivalent available in the US market?

Thank you!
Monthly portfolio performance calculations
Hi all,

I'm working on setting up a spreadsheet in order to calculate the performance of my investment portfolio.

I'd like to have 2 calculations:

1. Using a time-weighted rate of return
2. Using a money-weighted rate of return

&#x200B;

For the time-weighted rate of return, I've setup the following:

&#x200B;

|Date|Beginning Value|Cashflow (deposit or withdrawal)|Ending Value|Daily Return|Daily Return +1|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|1 jan 2023|100|5|110|4.76%|104.76%|
|2 jan 2023|110|0|120|9.09%|109.09%|
|etc.||||||

Then I apply the formula =product(F:F)-1 to get the Time-weighted Return. The idea is that I can then use this to calculate the monthly and yearly TWR.

Is this the correct way to calculate this?

I wanted to use a similar approach to calculate the Money-weighted rate of return.

&#x200B;

|Date|Beginning value|Ending Value|Cashflow (deposit or withdrawal)|Net Cashflow|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|1 jan 2023|100|120|5|25|
|2 jan 2023|120|130|0|10|
|3 jan 2023|130|120|\-5|\-15|
|etc.|||||

I wanted to use the XIRR formula to do something like =XIRR(E:E,A:A). However, I realise that the XIRR is an annual number. I'd like to calculate it per month as well.  


How would I go about this? I'd love to get some guidance. I believe especially my MWR table is flawed, but I can't figure out why exactly.   


Thank you in advance!
What is wrong (risky) with a $6 mutual fund that pays $0.08/share monthly dividend? (Details Below)
I'm a VERY amateur, trading on a small scale. A mutual fund I bought fluctuates between $5.25 - $6.50 USD and pays a monthly dividend of exactly $0.08 per share (\~14% annual I believe). Over a year, buying a few at a time I now have 1600 shares, earning $128/month.

The fund has been around a long time and has always paid this rate. I would like to invest a large portion of my savings to earn that seemingly stable rate. Is there something about a mutual fund that makes them riskier than a stock? Are there tax implications of dividends compared to trading stocks? I don't care if the fund moves in value, the idea of a small gain every month is attractive to me.
Investing an Emergency Fund
I saved up about a six month emergency fund which I have sitting in a money market account. But as I've started to accumulate more money in a market index fund I have been wondering if keeping any money in a money market account makes sense so long as you have enough extra in stocks. The worst that can happen is that the market goes down right when I need the emergency fund, which could certainly happen together in an economic downturn. In that case I'd essentially be paying more for using the emergency fund.

Say the emergency fund is 20,000. If the stock market drops by half I'd basically be paying 40,000 to spend 20,000. On the other hand unless I need an emergency fund pretty regularly the returns from keeping it in the stock market will be much larger than the loss from needing money when the market is down. 

So my conclusion is that if I have a decent amount more than my emergency fund already in stocks, lets say 40,000 then it makes more sense to keep the emergency fund in stocks as well.

Does that make sense? Is there some other factor I'm not considering?

Edit:

This article seems to make a similar point: https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/123113/why-emergency-funds-are-bad-idea.asp
Vicion group investing is it legit?
Hello new investor here. I was wondering if anyone is familiar with investing with this group? I have family that's done it before and made there money back I'm just a little suspicious because it seems to good to be true. Is there a website that's good tonlopk at for investing? Thank you.
People who are waiting for interest rates to start going down, did you get back into the market yet?
At the beginning of the year, people were saying how it was so easy to predict the markets, that you just needed to wait until the Fed signals it’s going to decrease interest rates.

Those who believe that, did you buy back in yet or are you still waiting? If you did, what changed your mind?
Bonds or real estate (appreciation only) for 2-3 years a better option?
Is buying real estate (purely for appreciation, not any cashflow value) still a better investment than bonds? I’m seeing RE value up 4-5% YoY (solely looking at appreciation), and after deducting everything (down payment/mortgage difference/REA fee) it doesn’t really come out to as high as I though it would. When I look at current bonds, the rate is on par, if not, even higher. Am I misreading something to think bonds could be a better investment (at least for a 2-3 year time length).
Fifth third securities and Alliance Bernstein investments
My father recently passed away, and left a sizable inheritance.  Most is in IRAs that I need to take drawls on over the next 10 years. It was invested through Edelman financial engines and to consolidate some things and keep people local, I was looking at having investments to be handled with Fifth Third and Alliance Bernstein.

Anybody have any advice/recommendations for using the bank and AB for this? 

Thanks
Question about T. Bill auto-rolling and changing rates
When we buy treasury bills we can opt in auto-roll so that when they mature, it can automatically rollover to the next period.

My question is, since rates for different T-bills are always changing, isn't this a bad idea because the auto-roll can potentially rollover to a T-bill that has lower rates than another one if you manually re-selected it?

For example, if I get a T-bill that has 5% expected yield, and when it matures, it auto-rolls to another one with 4.8% (or even to its original 5%) expected yield, but there exists another T-bill that actually has 5.2% expected yield at that time, doesn't it mean that auto-rolling is bad?
If my time horizon on my IRA is 30 years, why wouldn’t I used a 3x Index fund instead of $SPY?
Hi, basically the title. I am in my twenties, and am soon opening a Roth IRA to supplement my 401k. As the title says, I am not going to be taking from this until retirement, which is decades out.

I understand that obviously 3x levered accounts are MUCH more volatile and pose more risk. However, if my time horizon is 20+ years, isn’t it sensible to use a 3x levered index fund? My rational being that over the course of 30 years, any volatility would just be noise and the market would ALMOST (obviously nothing guaranteed) certainly be higher then than now. 

Basically I would invest in a 3x levered account with the idea of holding until 10 years before retirement. At that point I would de-risk like most middle aged folks. Replace the 3x with SPY and increase my weighting towards fixed incomes etc.
